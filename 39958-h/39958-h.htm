<h1>LIFE HISTORY AND ECOLOGY
OF THE FIVE-LINED SKINK, EUMECES FASCIATUS</h1>

<p class="caption3 center">By</p>

<h2>Henry S. Fitch</h2>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The common five-lined skink (or common blue-tailed skink) is
a small woodland lizard, abundantly and widely distributed over the
eastern United States. Many authors have casually discussed this
lizard or have treated in detail some phase of its biology. Excellent
brief summaries of the known facts concerning its life history have
been published by Smith (1946:349-350 and 1950:187-188) and
Pope (1947:153-157). Nevertheless, no thoroughgoing study of its
life history and ecology has heretofore been made.</p>

<p>In 1932, taxonomic studies by Dr. Edward H. Taylor revealed that
the lizards previously referred to in the literature as <i>Eumeces
fasciatus</i>, actually were three closely related and similar, partly
sympatric species. Although Taylor&rsquo;s work was careful and detailed,
and indicated numerous minor differences by which the
three species could be distinguished, many herpetologists were
reluctant to accept his findings for nearly a decade thereafter.
Consequently a large amount of literature concerning five-lined
skinks is either obviously composite in the sense that it is based upon
two or three species, or is not definitely assignable to any one
species. In the study here reported upon, all pertinent literature
available to me has been examined, and evaluated, and important
findings of other authors have been incorporated in the discussion.
However, mine was primarily a field study, and in one small part
of the geographic range of the one species.</p>

<p>The University of Kansas Natural History Reservation is a tract
of 590 acres preserved as a natural area, available for the pursuit
of ecological studies. The studies undertaken include intensive
investigations of selected species of vertebrate animals. The main
criteria used in selecting these species have been whether or not
they were sufficiently abundant and generally enough distributed
to play an important role in the over-all ecology of the area, and
whether a species was sufficiently accessible for study with available
techniques. Among the 300 species of vertebrate animals recorded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
from the Reservation, the five-lined skink is one of those most
frequently noticed in the field. In actual numbers it is probably
exceeded only by the cricket frog (<i>Acris gryllus</i>), the leopard
frog (<i>Rana pipiens</i>), the ring-necked snake (<i>Diadophis punctatus</i>),
the prairie vole (<i>Microtus ochrogaster</i>) and perhaps the white-footed
mouse (<i>Peromyscus leucopus</i>). Although numerous, the skink is
not easy to study because it is secretive in its behavior, and is inactive
in inaccessible shelters during the greater part of the year.</p>

<p>The five-lined skink generally occurs along with a characteristic
set of community associates in a particular type of situation. It is a
predator on various small animals, mostly invertebrates. For some
of the many prey species the effect is certainly negligible, but for
others its predation may be a major ecological factor. In areas
where optimum habitat conditions exist its biomass may exceed
that of any other insectivorous animal, and in such situations it
assumes a major role as a predator and as a competitor with other
insectivorous types. In turn it provides part of the food source of
various larger predators, including reptiles, birds and mammals.
It is a host and carrier of various parasites, including at least one
species that regularly attacks humans&mdash;the common chigger. It
is not evident on the basis of the present findings that the skink
is either harmful or beneficial to any perceptible degree, in its
over-all effect on human affairs and economy. Nevertheless, there
probably are various unsuspected relationships.</p>

<p>In the course of my field study many workers on the University
of Kansas Natural History Reservation helped by capturing skinks;
especially Sydney Anderson, Richard Freiburg, John Hawken, Dennis
G. Rainey and Lewis L. Sandidge. Mr. Robert Gordon very
kindly furnished information on specimens in the Tulane University
collection, which served as a basis for comparing the breeding
schedule of the southern population with that of <i>E. fasciatus</i> in
northeastern Kansas. Dr. W. J. Breckenridge kindly permitted
examination of material in the University of Minnesota Museum of
Natural History. Dr. Edward H. Taylor has made helpful suggestions
from time to time. Mr. Richard B. Loomis helped me in
various ways with the field work, and made available his personal
field notes with records of predation on <i>Eumeces</i> by various snakes.
Dr. E. Raymond Hall, Director of the Museum of Natural History,
has critically examined the manuscript, and has been helpful in
various ways. The line drawings and graphs, with the exception
of Figures <a href="#fig8">8</a> and <a href="#fig9">9</a>, were made or completed by Mrs. Louise Brunk,
artist for the Museum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>The study here reported on was initiated in May 1949, and was
continued through 1950, 1951 and 1952. A few observations made
in 1948 have been included. Various separate items of information
obtained in 1953 have likewise been incorporated especially where
histories of individual skinks are presented, but the manuscript was
completed in essentially its present form in the fall of 1952.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>Skinks were obtained by active search; rocks and boulders were
lifted up and the skinks thus exposed were seized by hand before
they had time to escape. This method was effective when the
skinks were using rocks for shelter and when temperatures were
low enough so that they were slow and sluggish, but in hot weather
the skinks were so quick and active that those exposed usually escaped.
Usually skinks could be obtained much more easily by
trapping. At the pond rock pile (<a href="#fig26">Fig. 26</a>), for instance, shelter was
so readily available that the skinks could seldom be caught by
hand. Gallon cans buried with the tops open flush with the surface
of the ground served as pitfalls and were effective when they were
carefully placed, at the bases of rock ledges or logs or stumps, where
the skinks were most likely to fall into them. Most of the skinks
recorded at the rock pile were caught by this method, and sometimes
several were caught together in the same pitfall. Ordinarily
each pitfall was covered with a large flat rock, propped against a
nearby object to leave ample space for the skink to enter beneath
it. The rocks provided protection from direct sunlight, from rain,
and from predators. Still another method of catching skinks was
with wire screen funnel traps (Fitch 1951:77). These funnel traps
were of different sizes, and were made of different kinds of wire
mesh. They were set for reptiles that were mostly larger than five-lined
skinks, and those having quarter-inch wire mesh permitted
many of the immature skinks to escape. Most of these funnel traps
were from about one foot long and five inches in diameter, to about
twice these dimensions, with funnel openings about 1.5 inches in
diameter. Some made of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch wire mesh, six or seven inches
long, and three or four inches in diameter, with funnel openings
only a little larger than the body diameter of an adult skink, were
found to be suitable for skinks of all sizes, and were used successfully
at the pond rock pile. Most of the skinks trapped were adult
males, and they were taken chiefly in May. The funnel traps were
generally placed at the edges of rock outcrops, boulders or logs,
where skinks were likely to be intercepted in their usual travel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
routes. Each method of collecting skinks resulted in occasional
mortality to them but most losses were in those caught in funnel
traps. In these traps they sustained rapid loss of moisture, and
were usually somewhat desiccated. Two or more adult males were
often caught together, and in most of these instances the first one
caught probably served as bait attracting another and arousing his
pugnacious interest. Injuries were frequent, and some deaths occurred
because in the close confines of a trap the loser in a fight
was unable to escape further attacks.</p>

<p>Most of the skinks caught were examined, and released within a
few minutes. Snout-vent length was measured by holding the
skink against a rigid transparent plastic millimeter ruler and exerting
a slight pull on each end of the lizard until it tired and relaxed
its muscles, eliminating bends and kinks. Even with such precaution,
precise measurements could not be obtained and the readings
often varied a millimeter or more for the same skink measured
two or more times on the same day. Tail length was similarly recorded
with separate readings for the original and regenerated
portions. Also recorded were sex (when discernible), color and
pattern, breeding data, injuries, general condition, and sometimes
temperature. Many of the skinks were brought to the laboratory,
and were weighed to the nearest tenth of a gram.</p>

<p>Occasional trips were made to localities away from the Reservation
to collect skinks. Some of those obtained were kept under
observation in terraria where their behavior was studied. Most
were preserved and were used for data on habitat preferences,
seasonal changes in the gonads, size group, stomach contents, and
various other items of information.</p>


<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The scutellation and osteology have been described in detail by
Taylor (1936:39-48 and 199-206) and others, and need not be repeated.
The five-lined skink is slender and elongate, somewhat
snake-like (though much less so than many other skinks) as the head,
neck, body, and tail are not well set off from each other, and the
sleek, streamlined contours are broken only by the small limbs protruding
from the sides of the body. The body is slightly flattened
laterally, tending toward quadrangular shape in cross section. The
head is wedge-shaped, with a short, rounded snout. The nostrils
are laterally placed, well back from the tip of the snout. The eyes
are small and deep set; the iris is dark. The neck is thick and strong,
nearly as long as the head. The torso is 3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> to 4 times as long as it
is wide. The tail is almost square in cross section at its base, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
is circular in cross section for most of its length. The limbs are
moderately developed; when adpressed along the sides of the body,
the forelimb and hind limb overlap by a length about equal to the
longest toes of the forelimb. The limbs are pentadactyl and all the
toes are well developed and have claws (Figures <a href="#fig1">1</a> and <a href="#fig2">2</a>). The
claws are short, and are curved in such a manner that their tips are
directed downward, each approximately at right angles to the axis
of the toe (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2b</a>). The limbs are moderately thick and
muscular. The upper arm and forearm segments are of approximately
equal length, as are the femoral and tibio-fibular segments
of the hind limb.</p>

The five-lined pattern is characteristic of the hatchling, but
gradual ontogenetic change results in its dulling, suppression, and
eventual loss. In the hatchling the ground color of the head and
body is black or dark brown, with five milky white longitudinal
stripes extending the length of the head and body, and on the basal
one-fourth of the tail. The five light lines are of approximately equal
width, and are separated by dark interspaces 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> to 2 times as wide.
The mid-dorsal stripe includes most of the two mid-dorsal scale
rows. Posteriorly it extends onto the base of the tail, where it becomes
increasingly suffused with the blue color of the tail, widens,
and loses its identity. In the nuchal region, this dorsal stripe narrows
and splits into left and right branches, which diverge anteriorly
to form a lyrate pattern on the head. On either side of the dorsal
stripe are the dark interspaces, nearly twice as wide as the stripe
itself and tapering to a point posteriorly on the tail, likewise tapering
anteriorly to a point immediately above and in front of the eye.
Lateral to these dark areas are the dorsolateral stripes; they extend
from the basal one-fourth of the tail anteriorly onto the head along
the superciliary region, tapering to a point on the anterior superciliary.
Below these stripes are the dark lateral areas which extend
from the basal part of the tail anteriorly along the sides of body and
neck region (including the upper half of the aperture of the ear),
eye region, and loreal region. Below this dark area on each side is
the lateral stripe. It extends along the sides just above the level
of the limb insertions (broken or pinched to a fraction of its average
width above the hind limb insertion), broken by the ear opening,
and extending anteriorly to include all the supralabial scales (with
the exception of their upper edges) and the rostral. Here the left
and right lateral stripes may be said to join; however in the facial
region these stripes are not well defined, partly because the dark
areas that border their lower edges do not extend so far forward.
This lowermost dark area is about equal in width to the lateral
stripe. It extends from the posterior infralabials posteriorly, to
include the fore- and hind-limbs, and onto the basal part of the tail.
The ventral surface of the head and body is dull white or pearly
gray.</p>

<p>Thus, there are 12 longitudinal bands of color on the body: the
five narrow, subequal, pale lines separated by the six dark areas,
of which the dorsal and dorsolateral are broad and of approximately
equal width, while the ventrolateral is narrower; and lastly the
broad, pale ventral area.</p>

<p>The tail in young individuals is bright blue. In <i>Eumeces</i> the tail
characteristically has a color different from that of the body, and is
usually more conspicuous; in many species it is blue, but in others it
may be purple, greenish-blue, red, pink, or orange. Hatchlings have
the most brightly colored tails, and as growth proceeds the colors
gradually become duller. In <i>E. fasciatus</i> the bright colors of the
tail are mostly or entirely lost in old adults, especially in males,
and in individuals of either sex that have lost their original tails
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and regenerated new tails. Young which lose their tails and regenerate
them at an early age have the regenerated portions colored almost
as brightly as the originals at first.</p>

<p>The skin is tight fitting and relatively thick, stiffened by a bony
armor. A small bony plate or osteoderm underlies each scale.
Oliver (1951:127) has called attention to the pattern of ornamentation
on the osteoderms, which becomes more complex with advancing
age. He has suggested the possibility that age might be accurately
determined on the basis of extent of osteodermal ornamentation.
I have compared osteodermal ornamentation in marked
individuals of known age, but have found it to be of limited applicability
as a method of age determination; size and pattern are probably
more satisfactory bases for estimating age, even though they
do not permit definite aging of old adults and are not infallible
for skinks short of adult size. In adult <i>E. fasciatus</i> the pattern of
ornamentation is closely similar to that figured for <i>E. laticeps</i> by
Oliver (op. cit.) and also resembles the pattern shown for an Old
World skink, <i>Mabuya multifasciata</i>, as figured by Smith (1935: 2).
The pattern differs somewhat in osteoderms on different parts of
the body, and is most nearly symmetrical in those near the midline
on either dorsal or ventral surface (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>).</p>


<h2>Relationships</h2>

<p><i>Eumeces</i> is a widespread genus occurring in the New World in
southern Canada and southward into Costa Rica. The greatest
number of forms is in Mexico. In the Old World numerous species
occur in southeastern Asia and on adjacent islands, and other species
occur westward across southern Asia, and across North Africa
to Morocco, with a major break in the continuity of distribution in
the Himalayan region. Taylor in his revision recognized 57 forms
with fifty full species, belonging to 15 major groups within the
genus. Since then only relatively minor changes in classification
have been proposed. Several new species and subspecies have
been named, and several species have been relegated to the status
of subspecies.</p>

<p>Within the genus there are several groups that have representatives
in both the New World and the Old World. Smith and Etheridge
(1953:159) point out that the most primitive line of <i>Eumeces</i>
is best represented in the Old World, where there are two groups
and nine species, while in the New World this line has only three
tropical relict forms. For this reason, Smith and Etheridge concur
with Taylor (1936:67) in considering the genus to be of Old World
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
origin; but the two main lines of the genus (the four-lined and five-lined
stocks) are both regarded as being of New World origin. According
to this idea, the Asiatic members of these two groups migrated
from the New World. In the early Tertiary, warm temperate
climates extended north to the Arctic Circle, and <i>Eumeces</i>, or at
least some of its species, may have had a distribution straddling
migration routes to both North America and Asia.</p>

<p>Of the 15 groups within the genus, the <i>fasciatus</i> group, with a
dozen species, has more representatives than any other. The
<i>fasciatus</i> group is characterized by having the tail bright blue with
dorsal body pattern of five light lines on a darker ground color; mid-dorsal
line bifurcating on head to form lyrate markings (this striped
pattern and bright color of the tail becoming dull or obsolete in
the adults); medial preanal scales overlapped by those lateral to
them; two pairs of nuchals; no postfemoral pocket; four supraoculars;
scales on sides of body in parallel rows. The characters that
separate members of the <i>fasciatus</i> group from each other are minor.
The width and position of the light lines differ somewhat among
them. The mid-dorsal light line bifurcates either on the nuchals
or on the parietals. The complex of scales in the temporal region
differ in shape and relative size.</p>

<p>The following table, compiled mostly from information set forth
by Taylor (1936:186-283), indicates some of the main differences
and similarities between species in the chief characters upon which
the classification is based.</p>

<p>The close resemblance between <i>E. fasciatus</i> and its Asiatic relatives
is remarkable considering the great distance separating them
and the long time that must have elapsed since their isolation began.
Some of the Asiatic forms differ from each other almost as
much as they differ from <i>fasciatus</i>. Of the Asiatic species, <i>elegans</i>,
<i>tamdaoensis</i>, <i>oshimensis</i>, and <i>marginatus</i> differ from <i>fasciatus</i> in
markedly larger size; <i>elegans</i>, <i>marginatus</i>, <i>oshimensis</i>, and <i>stimsonii</i>
differ in lacking a postnasal; all but <i>tamdaoensis tunganus</i> and
<i>xanthi</i> differ in having only a single postmental; all but <i>tunganus</i>,
<i>E. latiscutatus okadae</i> (and sometimes <i>oshimensis</i> and <i>elegans</i>)
differ in reduced number of scale rows; all but <i>tunganus</i> differ in
having a lateral postanal scale differentiated, and usually keeled;
<i>tunganus</i>, <i>xanthi</i> and <i>elegans</i> differ in having a patch of enlarged
scales on the posterior side of the thigh; and in all, the primary
temporals and upper and lower secondary temporals differ in size
and proportions. Although some of the Asiatic forms seem to be
directly derived from others, <i>fasciatus</i> is somewhat intermediate
between the more divergent forms, and fulfills most of the conditions
to be looked for in an ancestral type.</p>

<p>The American <i>Eumeces laticeps</i> and <i>E. inexpectatus</i> seem to be
more specialized than <i>E. fasciatus</i> and might have been derived
from it or from a common ancestor differing but little from the
modern <i>fasciatus</i>. Both differ from <i>fasciatus</i> in having more scale
rows. <i>E. laticeps</i> also differs in having eight instead of seven supralabials
and in having the median subcaudal scales greatly widened,
in having intercalated plates on the outer side of the fourth toe
nearly to the ultimate phalanx, posterior supralabial low and
elongate, young sometimes seven-lined instead of five-lined, and
especially in much larger size, stocky build, and in early loss of
striped pattern. <i>E. inexpectatus</i> differs in having the median subcaudals
not at all enlarged, and in having the dorsolateral stripes a
little more widely separated from the midline.</p>

<p><i>Eumeces fasciatus</i> and its relatives present a curious exception to
Jordan&rsquo;s Rule, which states that the nearest relatives of any given
species are to be found neither in the same area nor in a remote
one, but in an adjacent region separated by a barrier. <i>E. fasciatus</i>
is absent from almost all of Florida; otherwise its range overlaps
most of the ranges of both <i>laticeps</i> and <i>inexpectatus</i>, the former
including the southeastern United States south of about latitude
40&#176;, and the latter being mainly in the Atlantic and Gulf states from
Chesapeake Bay into eastern Louisiana. Presumably both of these
species began their differentiation as southern populations of an
ancestral <i>fasciatus</i> and later became isolated from it and continued
their differentiation until they overlapped it again as distinct
species. The differentiation of <i>laticeps</i>, being much greater, presumably
took place at an earlier time than did that of <i>inexpectatus</i>,
and at present it overlaps <i>fasciatus</i> more extensively. <i>E. laticeps</i>
probably diverged to such an extent that competition with <i>fasciatus</i>
is greatly reduced where the two species occur together.</p>

<p>Since <i>Eumeces laticeps</i> was recognized by Taylor as a species
distinct from <i>fasciatus</i>, numerous authors have accumulated field
observations that demonstrate ecological divergence between the
two. Conant (1951:33) wrote that in Ohio <i>laticeps</i> prefers a dry
habitat of bare rocks, cliffs, dry hillsides, and trees. He summed up
the habitat difference as follows: &ldquo;<i>Fasciatus</i> appears to be essentially
terrestrial, to prefer a moist environment and to be at home
in ravines in southern Ohio. <i>Laticeps</i> on the other hand, is largely
arboreal (particularly adults), prefers dry cliffs, sunny hillsides and
hilltops and lives in general above the habitat of <i>fasciatus</i>.&rdquo; Netting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
(1939:127) likewise states that in Pennsylvania <i>E. laticeps</i> inhabits
drier places than does <i>fasciatus</i>, and is largely arboreal. Other
authors with few exceptions agree that <i>laticeps</i> is largely arboreal,
but most describe it as at home in forest swamps and bottomlands.
My own field experience with it is limited. In the Pigeon Lake
area of Miami County, Kansas, the northwesternmost known locality
of occurrence for <i>laticeps</i>, the habitat relations described by Conant
for Ohio were almost reversed. <i>Eumeces laticeps</i> was relatively
scarce, and confined to the vicinity of the swamp chiefly in areas
that are flooded in time of high water. All those seen were on or
near massive snags of dead trees still standing, but decayed and
honeycombed with cavities. Slabs of bark clinging loosely to the
tree trunks, with spaces beneath, provided shelter for the skinks and
for the abundant arthropod fauna which probably constituted their
chief food source. This is one of the few places in Kansas where a
remnant of the original bottomland forest remains. In central
Louisiana, in 1947 and 1948, persons living on the Kisatchie National
Forest told me of large, red-headed skinks living in hollow trees,
which must have been <i>E. laticeps</i>. In the literature <i>E. laticeps</i> is
frequently referred to as red-headed, although the reddish suffusion
on the head of the adult male is ephemeral in this species as it is in
<i>E. fasciatus</i> and others. The heightened activity of the adult males
in the breeding season seems to have drawn attention to this conspicuous
temporary coloration while its absence at other seasons
has scarcely been mentioned.</p>

<p>Mansueti (1948:213) describing the habits of <i>laticeps</i> in Maryland,
Louisiana and elsewhere in the southern states, emphasizes
its arboreal habits, referring to it as &ldquo;&lsquo;scorpion&rsquo; of the treetops.&rdquo; He
describes it as dashing up and down tree trunks, along fences, and
in abandoned buildings. However, he states that it also spends
much time on the ground, and may take refuge in holes and cracks
near ground level, and gravid females are less arboreal, making
their nests in decayed logs of chestnut or oak. He mentions individuals
having been found living far above ground in tall trees, in
nests of birds of prey. One old male that was frequently seen by
him always retreated far up a dead chestnut tree that towered above
the surrounding forest of scrub pine. Mansueti also mentions
arboreal combats between males and implies that they are territorial.
Taylor (1936:59) described <i>laticeps</i> as typically an arboreal form,
almost invariably found in trees, and he indicated that it has claws
more curved than in other species&mdash;an obvious arboreal adaptation.
Parker (1948:25), however, stated that &ldquo;<i>E. laticeps</i> is reputed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
be rather arboreal, but field work in western Tennessee has not
borne out this belief. A few of the specimens have been found in
tall, dead trees, as has <i>E. fasciatus</i>.&rdquo; This statement evidently was
based on a small number of observations.</p>

<p>Cook (1943:15) mentions a female <i>laticeps</i> found in a nest with
a clutch of 27 eggs (hence certainly a communal nest of two or more
females) in a burrow under a log, on July 8, 1941, in Lee County,
Mississippi. This account is under the name <i>Eumeces fasciatus</i> but
the large size of the female precludes the possibility of it being
either <i>fasciatus</i> or <i>inexpectatus</i>. The remainder of Cook&rsquo;s account
is evidently based on a composite of observations on all three
species.</p>

<p>Goin and Goin (1951:29-33) have given an excellent brief account
of behavior and seasonal schedule in a small colony of <i>E.
laticeps</i> near Gainesville, Florida, based on almost daily observations
over a period of years. In view of the greatly different climatic
conditions, the seasonal schedule is remarkably similar to
that of <i>E. fasciatus</i> in Kansas, and it seems that the minimum threshold
temperatures required for activity are much higher in <i>laticeps</i>.
Temperatures of 80&#176; F. or above for several consecutive days
seemed to be a necessary stimulus for emergence from hibernation;
emergence was in the last week in March or the first week in April
in Florida. Hatching was found to take place in late June or early
July. Adults were last seen before retiring into dormancy in the
latter half of September and young of the year remained active into
October some two or three weeks later. The skinks observed all
lived in hollow water-oaks. When the population was at an especially
high level, in the late summer of 1949, each hollow oak was
inhabited by one young and one adult. Territoriality and mutual
exclusiveness of adults and even of young seems to be implied. The
skinks were seen eating spiders, ants, and cockroaches.</p>

<p>Neill (1950:115) mentions one sizable colony of <i>E. laticeps</i> living
in a treeless urban area, in Georgia and depending for shelter on
piles of metal drums and other industrial equipment. Evidently,
however, this was an exceptional situation. In another paper, Neill
(1948b:109) described the specialized hibernation site requirements
of <i>laticeps</i> in Georgia; the skink retires inside large, rotting
pine stumps, especially those that are leaning. He states (1948a:157)
that in Georgia, <i>laticeps</i> is most common in the Coastal
Plain and is much less numerous above the Fall Line (the line between
the Coastal Plain and the Piedmont). Deckert (1918:31)
wrote of &ldquo;<i>Plestiodon fasciatus</i>&rdquo; in the vicinity of Jacksonville,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Florida, where only <i>E. laticeps</i> and <i>E. inexpectatus</i> occur: &ldquo;Inhabits
hollow trees, always near water. Blue-tailed ones often live around
human habitations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With regard to the ecological traits of <i>E. inexpectatus</i> that distinguish
it from <i>fasciatus</i>, authors are much less definite, and evidence
is somewhat conflicting as the differences are relatively minor.
Engels (1949:269) noted the occurrence of <i>E. inexpectatus</i> on two
low islands of submarine origin, off the North Carolina Coast,
Harkers Island and Shackelford Banks, and he surmised that the
absence from them of <i>E. fasciatus</i> and <i>E. laticeps</i> must have some
ecological significance, since all three species occur on the adjacent
mainland. Most of the island <i>inexpectatus</i> were taken from beneath
loose bark of standing trees, while mainland <i>fasciatus</i> was taken
from beneath loose bark of fallen trees.</p>

<p>Barbour and Carr (1940:129) wrote of <i>inexpectatus</i> in the vicinity
of Miami, Florida: &ldquo;&#8230; it seems to be the only one [of the
five-lined skinks] which has adapted itself to life under the rather
specialized environmental conditions existing in its rocky and decidedly
tropical habitat. It is one of the very few forms which have
established themselves on some of the waterless and poorly vegetated
islands on both coasts of the peninsula. <i>E. inexpectatus</i> is
much less arboreal than either <i>laticeps</i> or <i>fasciatus</i>. Although it
climbs trees when pressed, it is usually found on the ground among
leaves or about fallen logs, and particularly about stone walls or old
buildings made of cut rock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the other hand, Neill (1948a:157) states that in Georgia,
<i>inexpectatus</i> is often observed basking on tree trunks, and though
adults often forage on the ground, they dash for the nearest tree
when disturbed, usually climbing to a considerable height before
halting. The juveniles, however, are said to climb only rarely; they
hide beneath objects on the ground when they are pursued. Neill
stated that <i>E. inexpectatus</i> occurs in dry pine forests where <i>laticeps</i>
and <i>fasciatus</i> are lacking, as well as in moist or even swampy woods.
<i>E. inexpectatus</i> often forages on the sides of old buildings.</p>

<p>Hoffman (1953:172), in discussing means of differentiating between
<i>inexpectatus</i> and <i>fasciatus</i> in Virginia, states that there are
ample differences in color and behavior as well as in scalation. He
describes the color difference (blue color of tail of juveniles extending
anteriorly beyond pelvis; light stripes reddish-orange on head,
sublateral line present, in <i>inexpectatus</i>) but he does not describe
the differences in behavior. He states that <i>inexpectatus</i> is the most
abundant lizard in southeastern Virginia. Carr (1940:76) also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
states that <i>inexpectatus</i> is less arboreal than <i>laticeps</i> and is often
found under logs and boards in dry sand.</p>

<p><i>E. inexpectatus</i> thus seems to be adapted to a somewhat drier,
more open, habitat than that typical of <i>fasciatus</i>, but it is not clear
whether either species is more arboreal in habits. It is to be hoped
that the present inconclusive summary will draw attention to the
problem and will lead to more critical comparisons of the habitats
and behavior of the two species by herpetologists in the southeastern
states. The differences, both ecological and morphological, that
distinguish <i>inexpectatus</i> from <i>fasciatus</i> are of a degree usually found
between subspecies of the same species. The extensive geographic
overlap between them is indeed remarkable in view of the slight
degree of differentiation, morphologically and ecologically. They
are, however, complementary in part in their ranges, while <i>laticeps</i>
shares all parts of its range with either one or the other, or both of
them (see Figures <a href="#fig4">4</a> and <a href="#fig5">5</a>).</p>

those of doubtful validity.</p>
</div>

<p>Under present conditions, with these three species so similar in
habits and so extensively overlapping in geographic range, it is
difficult to visualize a barrier such as would have been required for
allopatric speciation of the type, usual in vertebrates, to have occurred.
One might be tempted to postulate sympatric speciation,
with the parent form, presumably <i>fasciatus</i>, giving rise to the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
two by abrupt mutations. However, the demonstrable antiquity
of the five-lined skinks would allow ample time for divergence,
allopatric speciation, and subsequent disappearance of the barrier
and intermingling of populations. The displacement of floras and
faunas that occurred in the Pleistocene, with the successive advances
and retreats of the continental ice sheets might have had some part
in bringing about the present overlapping distribution, after the
disappearance of the original barrier. Such a barrier might have
been an eastward extension of the central grasslands to the Atlantic
Coast at a time when the climate of the continent was warmer and
drier.</p>

<h2>Habitat and Limiting Factors</h2>

<h3 class="smcap">Temperature and Moisture Relations</h3>

<p>For approximately half the year, at the latitude of northeastern
Kansas, five-lined skinks are dormant. In early fall, even before
the advent of cold weather, they are hard to find apparently having
begun their retirement into the sheltered situations where they
spend the winter, even though they may not be fully dormant at
that time.</p>

<p>Remarkably little is known of the hibernation habits of this
species or of reptiles in general for that matter. The limit of tolerance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to low temperatures, the type of insulating medium, the moisture
relationships, the specific stimuli which cause the animal to
retire to its hibernation site or to emerge from it have not been determined.
On only a few occasions have natural hibernating sites
or the dormant skinks in them been observed by zoologists. Linsdale
(1927:78) recorded one found in a sawdust pile late in the
winter of 1924 in Doniphan County, Kansas. Hamilton (1948:211)
found skinks of this species hibernating in Grant Parish, Louisiana,
in hollow logs 18-20 inches in diameter, five in one log and three in
another, on January 23, 1943. Frost in the damp wood almost
reached the lizards, which were in a torpid condition. These observations
were made when the temperature was 36&#176;F. after the
weather had begun to moderate following an unprecedented four-day
cold wave when temperatures dropped to within a few degrees
of 0&#176;F. In both logs the skinks were accompanied by hibernating
anoles (<i>Anolis carolinensis</i>). Neill (1948b:109) in Richmond
County, Georgia, found <i>E. fasciatus</i> hibernating in old stumps,
fallen timber, piles of debris, or beneath rocks and ground litter.
Beneath scraps of rotting wood he often found dead, frost-rimmed
specimens which apparently had frozen to death. Hibernating
skinks of this species were found singly or in pairs. Some were not
fully dormant when found but could only gape and twist when
uncovered.</p>

<p>Of hibernating <i>E. laticeps</i>, Neill wrote, &ldquo;Many examples are
covered with a waxy exudation, which I believe to be a secretion
of the lizard itself, rather than of the surrounding medium. This
exudation has been noted in other species also.&rdquo; Scott and Sheldahl
(1937:192) described a hibernating aggregation of <i>Eumeces septentrionalis</i>
found in Palo Alto County, Iowa, on February 15, 1937,
as follows: &ldquo;The skinks were found beneath a ledge of yellow clay
about four and one-half feet below the surface. The lizards, 52 in
number, were assembled in a compact group about the size and
shape of a football. A soft, web-like material surrounded the mass
and adhered to the bodies of the animals. Upon being uncovered
some of them exhibited signs of life; others were dead.&rdquo; Breckenridge
(1943:595) reported that a gravel digging crew found hibernating
<i>E. septentrionalis</i> in late October and in January at depths
of two feet (one), and three feet (groups of three and eight).
Tihen (1937:405) recorded that two five-lined skinks found on
January 13, 1948, were hibernating eight feet underground at Ranson,
Ness County, Kansas. This locality is far to the west of the
main range of <i>fasciatus</i>. Conant (1951:30) mentions the finding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in Ohio of a young blue-tailed skink under a log where it seemed
to be hibernating, on January 22. The spot where it was resting
was soggy, and surrounding areas were covered with several inches
of water.</p>

<p>In the course of the present study, no five-lined skinks were found
hibernating under natural conditions, but on numerous occasions
in early spring, two or three or four skinks were found together
under massive flat rocks in semi-torpid condition, beside deep
holes or crevices which presumably led to their hibernation sites in
better insulated cavities. In the winter none could be found in
such situations under large rocks, nor in the superficial types of
hibernation sites described by Neill and Hamilton in the southern
states. In the more severe winter climate of Kansas better protected
hibernation sites are required. In the rock ledge situations
where skinks were studied, excavation for the purpose of finding
hibernating individuals was not practical.</p>

<p>On several occasions when skinks were put in the freezing compartment
of a refrigerator and frozen solid, at temperatures several
degrees below freezing, they failed to revive when warmed. However,
they can survive temperatures a little below freezing. On
April 1, 1953, one was placed in the freezing compartment with a
thermometer inserted rectally. After 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> hours when the compartment
was opened, this thermometer showed a temperature of
-2.5&#176;C, after a delay of several seconds in obtaining a reading because
of condensed moisture on the thermometer obscuring the
mercury column. Another thermometer that rested beside the
skink in the compartment showed 27&#176;F. The skink was limp and
immobile. It was placed on a table top at normal room temperature,
and it warmed rapidly. When it had reached 1.5&#176;C, it contracted
its muscles in response to a light pinch. At 9.5&#176;C it raised
its head and had its eyes partly open. Twenty minutes after its
removal from the freezing compartment, it was still lying in the
same position, its temperature having reached 13.5&#176;C. When
handled it seemed dazed for several seconds as if just awaking.
Then it crawled away briskly.</p>

<p>On March 28, 1953, a skink was placed in the freezing compartment
for about 10 minutes, and upon removal its temperature was
recorded as -0.5&#176;C. It was not frozen, but was limp and unresponsive
to such stimuli as pinching or pricking. At 1.5&#176;C feeble movements
of the legs were noticed. The eyes were still closed. At
3.4&#176;C the legs moved as if in walking. At 6.0&#176;C the skink raised
its head and took several steps forward. At 7.5&#176;C it protruded its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
tongue and dragged itself about for several steps. At 9.0&#176;C movements
of the sides indicated an inspiration approximately every
three seconds. At 12.2&#176;C it opened its eyes.</p>

<p>On March 25, 1953, a skink that I had caught the day before and
left overnight in an unheated room, was found to have burrowed
into loose earth in its container. When exposed, its temperature
was 1.8&#176;C and it was unable to crawl normally, but took only one
step at a time, and progressed with slow lateral squirming motions.
Placed on the ground outside the building, in the shade where
there was still a little frost, it moved forward persistently for several
inches trying to burrow into the surface litter. After a few minutes,
its eyes were shut and it seemed incapable of further locomotion.
Its temperature was 1.4&#176;C. When placed on its back it was able
to turn over slowly after several seconds. A few minutes later its
temperature was 0&#176;C, and it was totally helpless, although still
capable of feeble movement. When stimulated by touch, it flexed
its body a little, or moved each limb slowly in an arc as if walking,
the movement taking several seconds. Placed on its back or side
it was unable to right itself.</p>

<p>Less than three hours later I saw a skink that was active in the
field. Slight movement at the edge of a rock that was exposed to
sunshine attracted my attention and turning the rock I found the
skink underneath, lively enough to scramble for shelter but slow
and stiff compared to those that are fully active. Its temperature
was 13.5&#176;C and air temperature was 7.5&#176;C. In damp soil beneath
the rock where the lizard was found, temperature was only 5.7&#176;C.
It seemed that the skink had been sufficiently warmed by contact
with the undersurface of the rock to move into the open, and was
just emerging when I approached. After capturing the skink, I set
it on a rock in the sunshine, and in five minutes its temperature
had risen to 26&#176;C.</p>

<p>As compared with its reptilian associates in northeastern Kansas,
<i>Eumeces fasciatus</i> is outstanding in its ability to become active and
carry on normal activities at relatively low air temperatures. In
spring it is usually seen in the open before any other kind of
reptile, because it has the capacity to move about sluggishly at
temperatures so low that some other reptiles are numbed and completely
immobilized, and because it has small size enabling it to
make rapid adjustment upward by insolation, or contact with sunshine-warmed
surfaces. By virtue of this ability it has been able to
extend its range farther northward than most other reptiles, and it
has gained the advantage of a longer growing season. This advantage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
was especially apparent in the spring of 1953. A mid-March
warm spell with seven out of eight successive days having maximum
temperatures in the sixties culminated on March 20, with a maximum
air temperature of 82&#176;F. This warmth was sufficient to activate most
of the five-lined skinks, and a few reptiles of other kinds. After the
unseasonably high temperature of March 20, there was rapid return
to cooler weather with temperatures frequently below normal
throughout April. As a result there was little activity of other kinds
of reptiles that month, but five-lined skinks were active on most
days. On only a few days, those with temperatures in the low
forties or those on which the sky remained overcast, did the skinks
remain inactive. On most days maximum temperatures were in the
fifties and sky was clear. Under these conditions the skinks were
able to emerge and bask, rapidly raising their body temperatures
far above those of the air and substrate.</p>

<p>By the end of April some kinds of deciduous trees have not yet
begun to leaf out, and in most other kinds the leaves are still in an
early stage of development. Absence of a leaf canopy during
April permits the skinks to utilize the spring sunshine to maintain
their body temperatures at almost the same high level that they
maintain in the same situations in hot summer weather.</p>

<p>Recent studies by Cowles and Bogert (1944:288-289) and Bogert
(1949:198) have brought out the fact that terrestrial poikilotherms,
and especially lizards, maintain fairly high and constant body temperatures
through behavioral thermoregulation, during their periods
of activity. For genera and species of lizards, there are optimum
body temperatures, which the individual tends to maintain, fluctuating
within a range of only a few degrees while it is active. Forms
that are not closely related may differ notably in their optimum
temperatures, although within any one genus the range is slight.
For example in the iguanid genus, <i>Sceloporus</i>, Bogert found that
different species from such distant regions as Arizona and Florida
agreed in having body temperatures approximating 35&#176; or 36&#176;C.,
while different members of the teiid genus <i>Cnemidophorus</i> in the
same two regions were found to approximate 41&#176;C. in mean temperatures.
In commenting on the distribution of North American
lizards as affected by opportunity for behavioral thermoregulation
by direct insolation, Bogert (<i>op. cit.</i>:205) wrote: &ldquo;Such secretive
lizards as skinks (principally <i>Eumeces</i> in North America) with low
body temperature preferences approximating 30&#176;C. are dominant in
Florida and the Gulf Coast, in contrast to the Teiidae and Iguanidae
(several genera in the United States), which are far more abundant
in the arid regions of the Southwest.&rdquo; Bogert and Cowles (1947:19)
record that in a large individual of <i>Eumeces inexpectatus</i> taken
near the Archbold Biological Station in Florida, the body temperature
was 33.2&#176;C.</p>

<p>In the 1952 season, a small thermometer of the type described by
Bogert (<i>op. cit.</i>:197) was frequently carried on collecting trips, and
cloacal temperatures were recorded for the lizards collected. For
those found in traps the opportunity for behavioral thermoregulation
was limited, and temperatures usually approximated those of
the air. The circumstances of capture, and the air temperatures
were recorded for most of the skinks taken. For those found under
rocks or in other shelter, the temperature usually approximated that
of the immediate surroundings, and averaged much lower than for
those taken in the open, but some found in such shelters had temperatures
many degrees higher than their surroundings, and were
fully active, having evidently just taken to cover to escape notice as
the collector approached. As soon as a lizard was secured it was
held in a leather glove or heavy cloth to prevent conduction of heat
from the collector&rsquo;s hand, and a reading was taken within a few
seconds. Most of the skinks found in the open could not be caught
immediately but were secured only after minutes of maneuvering
on the part of both collector and lizard. In most instances this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
maneuvering probably entailed some loss of heat by the lizard, as
it interrupted its thermoregulatory behavior to run to a place of concealment,
usually in shadow on a tree trunk, or in or beneath ground
litter. Excluding all those not found active in the open, the mean
temperature, in a sample of 41, was 31.5&#176;C. &#177; .60. This figure
is thought to be slightly too low because of heat loss by many of the
skinks in the time required to capture them.</p>

<p>In order to test the range of tolerance and verify the preferred
optimum temperature of the five-lined skink, an experimental terrarium
was set up providing extremes of temperature at each end.
A false floor of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> inch wire screen was provided, with a seven-inch
strip of galvanized sheet metal beneath it at each end. Beneath the
screen and sheet metal at one end the space was filled with chopped
ice, and &ldquo;dry ice.&rdquo; Observations were made on hot, clear summer
days, with the terrarium arranged so that the half of it containing
ice, was in shadow, and the other half was in sunshine. The strip
of metal, warmed by direct sunlight, became uncomfortably hot to
the touch while at the other end the sheet metal and overlying
screen were cooled by the ice. A narrow zone across the middle of
the terrarium had screen but no underlying sheet metal and was
the only part within which the lizard could maintain normal temperature,
one end being uncomfortably hot and the other end too
cool. A large dead skink left on the metal strip in direct sunlight for
five minutes had a cloacal temperature of 45.3&#176;C., and after five
minutes on the screen at the cool end, its temperature had dropped
to 25.5&#176;C. On several occasions a number of skinks were put in
the terrarium and their temperatures taken at brief intervals. Temperatures
ranged from 21.6&#176;C. to 37.7&#176;C. but were mostly within
a much narrower range, from 28&#176; to 36&#176;C. One skink that seemed
to be sick was sluggish in behavior, not responding to the extremes
of temperatures as readily as the other individuals and his temperature
fluctuated widely and irregularly. Eliminating this individual,
66 temperature readings taken, from five other skinks, gave a mean
of 32.6&#176;C. &#177; .235. While nearly all the temperature readings were
within a range of ten degrees, two of the readings were outstandingly
low and perhaps should be discarded. If this is done, a mean
of 33.8&#176;C. &#177; .19 is obtained for the remaining 64. There is distinct
bimodality in this series however, with a mean of 34.2&#176; for the 49
higher readings, and a mean of 28.8&#176;C. for the 15 lower temperatures.
A similar bimodality is evident in the readings obtained from
skinks caught in the open under natural conditions. It seems that
the lower readings result from lags in the skinks&rsquo; response when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
body temperature drops slightly below the optimum. The skink is
quick to make adjustment whenever its temperature appreciably
exceeds this optimum level, and is in extreme discomfort at only a
few degrees higher temperature. At slightly lower temperatures,
however, the skink experiences no discomfort, and only slightly decreased
efficiency in its various functions, and its thermoregulatory
behavior in making readjustment toward the optimum is likely to be
leisurely and interrupted unless its temperature drops below 28&#176;C.</p>

<p>Catching the skinks in the experimental terrarium at frequent
intervals to take their temperatures involved some disturbance to
them, interrupting their thermoregulatory behavior. The experimenter&rsquo;s
first attempt to grasp a skink sometimes failed, and it then
dashed about the terrarium for several seconds, probably altering
its temperature somewhat. Nevertheless most of the lizards&rsquo; movements
were motivated by thermoregulation. This was especially
evident when they were left undisturbed, and is illustrated by the
following notes on behavior of an adult female and half-grown young
of <i>fasciatus</i> and a young <i>E. obsoletus</i> on the afternoon of July 21,
1952.</p>

<p>Having once emerged from its hiding place a skink becomes
more or less independent of the temperature of the air and substrate,
as it is capable of thermoregulation through insolation.
However, after a period of cooling and inactivity in dormancy, or
merely resting for the night in temporary shelter, the skink is dependent
on warmth from the air or substrate or both to become
sufficiently activated so that it can emerge and take advantage of
direct sunlight. About 10:00 a. m. on April 13, 1951, when the air
temperature was a little less than 10&#176;C., a large adult male rustling
among dry leaves attracted my attention. Obviously recently
emerged from hibernation, he was caked with dried mud and his
eyelids were nearly sealed shut. He had been sunning, however,
and was active enough to elude my attempts to catch him, as he
scurried into a deep crevice under the ledge. On the morning of
March 24, 1951, while the temperature was still between 10&#176; and
15&#176;C., a subadult skink, the first one of the season, was seen sunning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
itself at the entrance of a deep crevice under the ledge. This
skink was still not fully active, and its movements were stiff, yet
it was alert and wary, and it quickly retreated back into the
crevice. During the first week of May, 1952, skinks were active in
abundance and numbers were caught daily in funnel traps and
pitfalls. On May 9, however, the maximum air temperature was
16.5&#176;C. with cloudy sky and occasional showers. Under these conditions
skinks stayed under cover; none was seen in the open nor
caught in a trap, and several found under rocks were slow and
sluggish. On May 10 a terrarium with several adults was placed
in dilute sunshine beside a window in an unheated room. After a
period of basking the skinks were stimulated to activity, but were
unable to attain normally high temperatures, and as a result their
movements were like slow motion caricatures of the normal behavior.
Males approached each other with menacing demeanor,
with heads turned, snouts depressed, and forequarters standing
high. Frequently one would edge up to another and bite hard at
its flanks. The several males were sexually aroused by the presence
of the two females, but were capable of only the preliminary phases
of courtship, in delayed and protracted form. The temperature of
one was 18.2&#176;C. when the sun had nearly set and activity was
tapering off, at an air temperature of 16.2&#176;C. At 16&#176;C. skinks in a
terrarium with no access to sunshine for the most part showed no
interest in food and kept out of sight under cover. When exposed
their activity was directed almost entirely toward burrowing into
the substrate or searching for objects beneath which to hide. One
adult female was partly exposed by scraping away loose soil into
which she had burrowed. A mealworm was then dropped just in
front of her head. She tested it several times with her tongue and
then ate it without emerging, her movements being much less brisk
than they normally are in feeding. Probably this approximates the
threshhold temperature for feeding behavior. At 19.5&#176;C. the several
skinks in this terrarium were moving about in the open although
they were not exposed to sunshine, and they accepted food
avidly when it was offered, but were much slower than at optimum
temperatures. On May 16, 1951, when a pair of skinks were put
together in a terrarium in the laboratory at 21&#176;C., copulation ensued
but it was of longer duration than in other observed instances,
seemingly because of the relatively low temperature.</p>

<p>Relatively few temperature readings on gravid or brooding females
under natural conditions were obtained as they were easily
disturbed and tended to desert their nests at slight provocation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
To avoid desertions handling was kept to a minimum. Occasionally
gravid females were caught in the open, but most of them were in
nest burrows under flat rocks. These females found in nests were
mostly cold to the touch, and the temperature readings taken on
some of them usually approximated the air temperature, being
either higher or lower (depending on whether the air was cooling
or warming and whether the lizards were warmed by contact with
rock or soil receiving sunshine). On May 23, 1952, 22 skinks were
seen, four adult males, seven adult gravid females, and 11 young.
Of these the adult females all were in nest burrows, and were cold
and slow; consequently all of them were caught without difficulty.
The males and young, however, were either fully warmed or warm
enough to escape rapidly, so that only three of the young and no
adult males were caught. Temperatures of the females tested
were 25.6&#176;, 23.6&#176;, 23.5&#176;, 22.3&#176;, and 19.4&#176;, and for the three young,
32.8&#176;, 28.4&#176;, and 28.4&#176;. Air temperature varied from 20.5&#176; to 24.8&#176;.
For the total of 30 females in nest burrows whose temperatures
were taken in 1952, the average was 26.3&#176;C, ranging from 16&#176; to
34&#176;. Gravid females, and those with nests and eggs were rarely
seen in the open.</p>

<p>The five-lined skink is confined to a region where summer rains are
frequent. It is evident that a regular supply of drinking water is
one of the most critical ecological requirements. Bogert and Cowles
(1947:19) found that an <i>E. inexpectatus</i> experimentally kept at
high temperature lost moisture at a more rapid rate than any other
reptile tested (including two other kinds of lizards, four kinds
of turtles, an alligator, and three kinds of snakes). They remarked
that this rapid moisture loss presumably accounts for the inability
of skinks to survive in containers when no moisture is readily available,
and also accounts for their absence in truly arid habitats.
The Natural History Reservation is situated near the western edge
of the species&rsquo; range in a climate that may be near the limit of its
range of tolerance. However, on most summer mornings low woodland
vegetation is copiously laden with dew, and this evidently
fulfills the need for drinking water. Diminution of surface activity
and retirement to underground retreats seem to be closely correlated
with cessation of rains in late summer. After rainless
periods in August and September, when morning dew is no longer
available these skinks, especially the adults, are no longer regularly
seen in the open. They have retreated to underground shelters
where they spend nearly all their time. The time of disappearance
varies from year to year and the correlation with varying weather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
conditions seems obvious. While no actual experiments were performed
to determine the moisture requirements, it is evident that
the need for moisture rises sharply with increased temperature.
Skinks that are dormant in hibernation survive for periods of months
without drinking, with but little loss of weight. In their underground
shelters temperature is low and presumably relative humidity
is high. At temperatures above their optimum of approximately
34&#176;C. the skinks are especially subject to rapid moisture loss,
since evaporation of body moisture is resorted to as a device to
keep the temperature below the lethal level. The skinks subjected
to extremes of temperature in an experimental terrarium were seen
to lap up condensed moisture on the cooled metal plate at intervals
of a few minutes. After an hour or more in the experimental terrarium
they seemed somewhat debilitated. Skinks brought from
the study areas to the laboratory for weighing and other records,
were ordinarily returned on the following day. When circumstances
prevented adherence to this schedule in hot summer weather, mortality
could be expected in the skinks kept in cloth bags or glass
containers, unless water was provided. Dramatic weight loss of
up to more than 30 per cent was recorded in some individuals,
kept at the high temperatures which usually prevailed in the
laboratory, over periods of days in the summer. Skinks having
access to drinking water often ingest amounts far beyond their
immediate requirements, which may be stored in the bladder and
drawn upon over periods of days as it is needed, or may be utilized
to dampen the soil of the underground shelter and raise the
humidity, as incubating females seem to do.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Geographic Range and the Deciduous Forest Habitat</h3>

<p><i>Eumeces fasciatus</i> corresponds in its distribution with the original
hardwood forests of eastern North America, as mapped by Braun
(1950:cover folder) and the &ldquo;Oak-Wild Turkey Biome&rdquo; of Shelford
(1945:240). Few species of vertebrate animals have ranges that
coincide more closely with this extensive area (exclusive of the
northern edge, that part characterized by Braun as the Hemlock-White
Pine-Northern Hardwoods). This latter is a mixed forest
which actually is transitional between the more typical deciduous
forest farther south and the Taiga Biome (or Formation) to the
north, which is dominated entirely by conifers. At the northern
edge of its range <i>Eumeces fasciatus</i> is much less generally distributed
than it is farther south. Although it is well established and
even may be locally numerous in South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
northern Michigan, Ontario, northern New York, and Connecticut,
the locality records from these states are few, and seemingly
represent isolated and widely separated colonies that are able
to persist because of favorable combinations of environmental
factors not of general occurrence in the surrounding regions. <a href="#fig6">Figure
6</a> shows the extent of the hardwood forests as mapped by Braun
(excluding the transitional Hemlock-White Pine-Northern Hardwoods
Association) with specific locality records of <i>E. fasciatus</i>
included in all outlying portions of the range. The locality records
are those published by Taylor (1936:206-212) supplemented by
other marginal records, more recently published, by Hamilton
(1947:64) for New York, Breckenridge (1944:97) for Minnesota,
Hudson (1942:42) for Nebraska, Smith (1950:185) for Kansas,
Brown (1950:116) for Texas, Neill (1948:156) for Georgia, and
Neill and Allen (1950:156) for Florida. Along the northern edge
of its range, the skink invades the Hemlock-White Pine-Northern
Hardwoods Association, in Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania,
Ontario, Michigan, and Wisconsin, but does not penetrate far
into it anywhere. Correspondence of its northern limits with those
of the Oak-Chestnut, Maple-Basswood, Beech-Maple and Oak-Hickory
associations is remarkably close, considering the fact that
the boundaries of these climax associations are not sharply defined;
rather they merge by gradual stages into the northern coniferous
forests, with outlying peninsulas and islands where conditions are
favorable.</p>

<p>The outlying northern localities where <i>E. fasciatus</i> occurs within
the Hemlock-White Pine-Northern Hardwoods Association are all
within the region of Pleistocene glaciation, which 20,000 years ago,
or even more recently, were covered with the continental ice mass
during Wisconsinan time. Yet the localized northern populations
of skinks evidently are relicts from a time when favorable conditions
were more widespread in the general region. Braun (<i>op. cit.</i>:464-465)
indicates five successive postglacial stages in the trends of
climate up to the present, as revealed by bog pollen profiles: (1)
Cool and moist; (2) warm and dry; (3) warm and humid; (4) warm
and dry; (5) cool and moist. Stages 2 and 4 would have been most
favorable for encroachment of the skink into glaciated regions,
whereas stages 3 and 5 might have caused retrenchment of its
populations. In view of the localized habits of individuals, and the
lack of any mechanism for rapid dispersal, the time available seems
no more than adequate for the distance of 200 miles or more northward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
that the skinks must have moved since the final retreat of the
ice sheet. This northward movement involved crossing of formidable
barriers such as the Great Lakes. Even minor barriers such
us small rivers and creeks, might be expected to halt population
movements for long periods.</p>

records (marginal and near-marginal records shown, excluding those of

northern coniferous forests. (2) The shaded area in Kansas that is outside the
Deciduous Forest Formation comprises the Kaw River District, Cherokee Prairie
District, and southern Osage Savannah Biotic District (Cockrum, 1952).</p>
</div>

<p>The over-all geographic range is approximately square, roughly a
thousand miles across, from north to south and from east to west.
On the east and south it is limited by the Atlantic Ocean and the
Gulf of Mexico. On the north and west its limits correspond with
those of the hardwood forests. On the northwest, it reaches southwestern
Minnesota and the southeastern corner of South Dakota,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
extending far out into peninsular extensions of the Oak-Hickory
Association which penetrate westward into the prairies along the
main river valleys.</p>

<p>In Kansas it occurs over the eastern one-fourth, west to the Flint
Hills, and a little farther west in peninsular extensions of the forest
along some of the main river valleys. In Braun&rsquo;s map the Deciduous
Forest Biome is shown to reach only the eastern edge of Kansas
along the Kaw River and Missouri River at and near their junction,
the Osage (or Marais des Cygnes) River valley near the Missouri
border, and the southeastern corner of Kansas. However, for almost
100 miles farther west from the Missouri border, the country has the
aspect of a savannah with scattered groves of trees on hillsides and
along streams, providing suitable habitat. The distribution of the
five-lined skink in eastern Kansas corresponds well with certain
&ldquo;Biotic Districts&rdquo; as mapped by Cockrum (1952:12), namely the
Kaw River, Osage Savannah (southern part), and Cherokee Prairie.
Conversely the skink is excluded from the Short Grass Plains and
Mixed Grass Plains Biotic Districts which occupy nearly all of the
western three-fourths of the state. There are two specimens in the
University of Kansas Natural History Museum, labelled Ranson,
Ness County. This locality, in the western third of the state, more
than 150 miles from any other recorded station, may represent an
isolated colony; however Smith (1950:185) states that the record
needs verification, and it is not included in the map, <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>.</p>

<p>In Oklahoma the distribution records fit fairly well the portion of
the state mapped by Braun as the Oak-Hickory Association of the
Deciduous Forest, but extends a little farther west in the northeastern
part of the state. A game type map published by the Oklahoma
Game and Fish Department, Division of Wildlife Restoration,
in 1943 shows in more detail distribution of the main vegetation
types within the state. The locality records for the skink fall almost
entirely within three of the fifteen vegetation types mapped, namely,
the oak-pine, and oak-hickory forest of the state&rsquo;s eastern edge and
the post oak-blackjack oak type of the eastern and central parts.
The locality records extend almost throughout the area occupied
by these three types but not in attenuate westward extensions of
the post oak-blackjack type that occur along several of the main
stream courses. In Texas likewise the recorded localities fall mainly
within the area mapped as deciduous forest, but with several slightly
beyond its boundaries. In a detailed map of the &ldquo;game regions&rdquo; of
Texas (Anonymous, 1945:1), some of these outlying localities fall
into the coastal prairie area, and the remainder into the post oak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and blackland prairie belts, which grade into each other and the
oak-hickory forest.</p>

<p>The former distribution of the five-lined skink may be postulated
on the basis of the fossil record of its community associates since it
is a primitive and conservative type. Taylor (1936:56) explained
the present discontinuous distribution of the genus on opposite sides
of the world on the basis of a former northern connection of the
continents. He wrote: &ldquo;I regard migration from North America to
Asia as having taken place via land bridges joining the Alaskan
peninsula with Asia either at Bering Straits or via the Aleutian Island
arc to Kamchatka, or both. One would need postulate but slight
climatic changes since the present climate of this coastal region is
probably no more rigorous than that of southern Canada which has
three species of the genus.&rdquo; However, such former northward distribution,
while entirely probable, would have been possible only in
a climate much milder than that which prevails at present. In Asia,
<i>tunganus</i> on the mainland and <i>latiscutatus</i> on the island of Hokkaido
extend north to about latitude 43&#176;, and in North America, <i>fasciatus</i>
extends slightly farther north. In order to have crossed between
Alaska and Asia on presumed land bridges these skinks would have
had to extend their ranges about 20 degrees north of their present
limits, into what is now a cool climate. The winter climate of the
Bering Sea is perhaps not much beyond the range of tolerance of
the more cold-adapted forms of <i>Eumeces</i>, but the cold, cloudy, wet,
and changeable summer climate is far beyond the range of tolerance
of <i>Eumeces</i> or any other lizard.</p>

<p>It is highly improbable that the fossil record will yield direct evidence
for the existence of a northern ancestral <i>Eumeces</i> of the
<i>fasciatus</i> group. The characters by which the various forms are
recognized are to be found mainly in details of pattern and scalation;
the skeleton is so conservative that specific characters are ill
defined or lacking even in well preserved fossil material. This hypothetical
ancestor probably was a member of a deciduous forest
community having components in common with the modern forests
where the American and Asiatic species occur, along with types now
extinct, and others which, though existing at the present time, have
become separated from their original associates and occur in other
regions.</p>

<p>Hollick (1936:11) has described a rich early Tertiary Alaskan
flora strikingly different from that of the same region at the present
time. Composed of genera now characteristic of warm-temperate
to subtropical climates, it was remarkable in having many types of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
plants that are now most characteristic of the North American hardwood
forests in the southeastern part of the continent. Besides
such widespread genera as <i>Fagus</i>, <i>Betula</i>, <i>Ulmus</i>, <i>Platanus</i>, <i>Castanea</i>,
<i>Corylus</i>, <i>Carpinus</i>, <i>Crataegus</i>, <i>Spiraea</i>, <i>Myrica</i>, <i>Smilax</i>, <i>Pinus</i>,
<i>Picea</i>, and <i>Abies</i>, this flora included others now characteristic of
both warm-temperate southeastern North America and Eastern
Asia, as <i>Magnolia</i>, <i>Nyssa</i>, <i>Sassafras</i>, <i>Persea</i>, <i>Benzoin</i>, <i>Hamamelis</i>,
<i>Liquidambar</i>, <i>Celastrus</i>, <i>Nelumbo</i>, and <i>Onoclea</i>. It included genera
<i>Carya</i>, <i>Taxodium</i> and <i>Comptonia</i> that now are limited to SE North
America, <i>Sequoia</i>, now limited to western North America, and
also included several genera which at present are limited to southeastern
Asia: <i>Ginkgo</i>, <i>Glyptostrobus</i>, <i>Cinnamomum</i>, <i>Hausmannia</i>,
<i>Artocarpus</i>, <i>Dillenia</i> and <i>Koelreuteria</i>. This fossil flora provides
strong evidence that in the early Tertiary climatic and habitat conditions
as far north as Alaska were favorable for the existence of an
ancestral <i>Eumeces</i> similar to the modern <i>E. fasciatus</i>, which might
have given rise to both North American and Asiatic members of the
<i>fasciatus</i> group.</p>

<p>There is abundant evidence for the existence of an Eocene land
connection between Alaska and northeastern Siberia, permitting free
interchange of faunas between the two continents, as shown by the
almost simultaneous appearance of various mammalian groups in
the fossil records of Asia and North America. Simpson (1947:627)
has summarized the evidence that such intermigrations were occurring
throughout most of the Tertiary, with occasional interruptions
as in middle Eocene, and in middle and late Oligocene, and
with increasing selectivity, chiefly a progressive tendency toward
screening out of the groups less tolerant of cold (judged on the
basis of their modern representatives). In the late Tertiary, and
especially in the Pleistocene, animals known to have made migrations
between North America and Asia were types now characteristic
of boreal climates (<i>e. g.</i> pika, hare, vole, lemmings, marmot,
jumping mouse, fox, wolverine, bear, moose, caribou, sheep, bison,
camels, mammoth). Simpson believes that there was fairly strong
climatic selectivity even in the Miocene interchanges, and he indicates
several important groups that were non-migrants in the Miocene,
most of them remaining so through the Pliocene and Pleistocene&mdash;the
primates, Rhizomyidae, Gliridae, Viverridae, Hyaenidae,
Dicerorhininae, Suidae, late Anthracotheriidae, Hippopotamidae,
Tragulidae, Muntiacinae, Lagomerycidae, Giraffidae, and Bovidae.
He states that there is good evidence that these are all mainly
warm-climate animals which are not likely to have ranged in any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
force into a cold-temperate or boreal environment. In view of these
conclusions it seems doubtful whether <i>Eumeces</i> or other reptiles
could have crossed the Alaskan-Siberian land connection so late as
the Miocene.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the climate and habitat conditions with which
<i>Eumeces</i> might have been associated, although present as far north
as Alaska in the Eocene, evidently had shifted far to the south by
mid-Tertiary time. Axelrod (1950:230) has described a Miocene
forest of the Columbia Plateau and northern Great Basin indicative
of a uniform temperate climate and an average rainfall of thirty-five
to sixty inches. This forest included: (<i>a</i>) various genera now
characteristic of the southeastern hardwood forest or confined to it&mdash;<i>Carya</i>,
<i>Castanea</i>, <i>Comptonia</i>, <i>Fagus</i>, <i>Liquidambar</i>, <i>Nyssa</i>, <i>Taxodium</i>;
(<i>b</i>) other genera at present more characteristic of the western
United States&mdash;<i>Sequoia</i>, <i>Lithocarpus</i>, <i>Pseudotsuga</i>, <i>Mahonia</i>,
<i>Thuja</i>, <i>Gaultheria</i>, <i>Amelanchier</i>; (<i>c</i>) wide-ranging genera including
<i>Alnus</i>, <i>Acer</i>, <i>Betula</i>, <i>Populus</i>, <i>Quercus</i>, <i>Picea</i>, <i>Pinus</i>, <i>Tsuga</i>, <i>Cornus</i>,
<i>Ribes</i>, <i>Rosa</i>, <i>Hydrangea</i>; (<i>d</i>) modern east Asian genera, including
<i>Ginkgo</i>, <i>Ailanthus</i>, <i>Glyptostrobus</i>, <i>Keteleria</i>, <i>Koelreuteria</i>, <i>Metasequoia</i>,
<i>Pseudolarix</i>, <i>Pterocarya</i>, <i>Zelkova</i>, which were eliminated from
the North American flora in the latter part of the Tertiary. In short,
this western Miocene forest was remarkably similar in many respects
both to the presumably ancestral early Tertiary Alaskan forest and
the modern southeastern hardwood forest. The extent of this
Miocene forest is unknown but judging from the sites where it has
been recorded, it had progressed about halfway, both in latitude
and in actual distance, from Alaska to the area occupied by the
modern southeastern deciduous forests. Several other reptilian
genera have distributions similar to that of the <i>fasciatus</i> group, with
representatives in southeastern Asia and southeastern North America
that probably have parallel histories of distributional divergence
from early Tertiary northern ancestors similar to contemporary
species (Schmidt, 1946:148-150). <i>Alligator</i>, <i>Natrix</i>, <i>Ancistrodon</i>,
<i>Scincella</i>, <i>Elaphe</i>, <i>Opheodrys</i>, and within the genus <i>Eumeces</i>, the
<i>obsoletus</i> group, all provide excellent examples.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Effect of Climatic Factors</h3>

<p>Accounts of the habits and habitat, by various authors, indicate
versatility in behavior, and adaptation to a variety of habitat conditions
in different climates and plant associations. Some of the
differences evidently result from the skink&rsquo;s tendency to maintain
itself in surroundings of favorable temperature and humidity, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
obviously are to be found in different types of situations at different
extremes of the range. Hence even though the skink itself may remain
unchanged, it tends to behave somewhat differently under
diverse environmental conditions. Such environmentally enforced
differences in habits would be difficult to distinguish from those
having a genetic basis. Although no subspecies of <i>Eumeces fasciatus</i>
have been recognized, local populations undoubtedly differ somewhat
in size and other characters that have a genetic basis.</p>

<p>At the northern edge of its geographic range, <i>fasciatus</i> occurs in
isolated colonies and seems to be restricted to open, rocky situations
which receive the maximum amount of sunlight. Breckenridge
(1944:96) wrote that at the two Minnesota localities representing
the northwestern corner of the known range, the skinks were found
at granite outcrops, and he mentions one found in western Wisconsin,
at Taylor Falls, under an 18-inch slab of a basalt outcrop in
sparse oak woods. Patch (1934:51) described a habitat at Arden,
Ontario, among massive granite-gneiss domes, with sparse vegetation.
At Point Pelee, Ontario, the species is common in the drier,
more sparsely wooded situations, hiding beneath loose bark of
stumps and logs.</p>

<p>Ruthven (1911:264) found <i>E. fasciatus</i> in the vicinity of sandy
beaches in the Saginaw Bay region of Michigan. Elsewhere in its
range it is more characteristically an inhabitant of hardwood forests,
preferring the better drained and more rocky situations, according
to the testimony of numerous authors. In eastern Illinois, Smith
(1947:33) found it confined to the area south of the Shelbyville
moraine, and not ranging into a prairie habitat. Near Elkville,
Illinois, Cagle found the species abundant in higher and drier areas
within sparse stands of oak in second growth woods, but it was
absent from the low swampy areas adjacent to streams. Conant
(1951:30, 210), describing the habitat in Ohio, stated that the species
does not occur in swamps and areas that are subject to spring
floods nor on dry hillsides, but is abundant in some areas where
there are rotting stumps and logs remaining from former patches of
swamp forest, and usually is found in low, moist situations, in
wooded valleys or even at the edges of swamps and bogs. Lynn
(1936:49) wrote that in Virginia, it is most often seen on steep,
boulder-strewn hillsides and old sawdust piles. In the central
Ozarks of Missouri, Owen (1949:49) found it abundant and saw it
almost daily on rocky ledges, fallen timber, and fence rails, while
<i>E. laticeps</i> was seen only once. Taylor (1936:59) wrote that <i>E.
fasciatus</i> occurs where there is timber and is often found about fallen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
trees and rotting stumps, or about old sawmills where wood refuse
has accumulated. Smith (1950:187) wrote that in Kansas the species
is commonly found in wooded areas in moist situations about
stones, leaves and rotten logs. Gloyd (1928:120) wrote that in
Franklin County, Kansas, <i>E. fasciatus</i> occurred in upland situations
and was the most abundant lizard where there were rocks, brush,
or decaying wood. Gloyd (1932:401) also recorded it as abundant
in the Pigeon Lake area, Miami County, Kansas, in wooded areas of
sufficient elevation to be out of the river flood-plain.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Habitat in Northeastern Kansas</h3>

<p>In northeastern Kansas I have collected or observed this skink in
several dozen localities, and searched unsuccessfully in numerous
other localities. Absence of this skink, in some situations and
its presence and relative abundance in others, provided a basis for
appraising the environmental factors that are of critical importance.
River valleys, of the Kaw and Wakarusa and their tributaries, with
deep alluvial soil, alternate with flat or rolling upland some two
hundred feet higher in elevation, and having shallow, rocky soil.
Where the uplands slope to the valley floors, there are steep hillsides,
usually with extensive limestone outcrops along their upper
slopes. The alluvial plains formerly supported hardwood forests,
while the hill slopes and uplands were largely prairie. At the
present time the bottomland forest has been almost completely destroyed,
as it grew on the most fertile and potentially productive
soil, and has been replaced by cultivated crops. There are still trees
along streambanks, and in occasional woodlots, but I have failed
to find any skinks in such situations. I doubt that they ever have
been numerous in the bottomland woods; lack of rocks for shelter,
and periodic flooding are unfavorable factors. In the Kaw flood of
June and July, 1951, for instance, the entire valley was inundated,
and in smaller tributary valleys such as that of the Wakarusa,
flooding is frequent at the season when skinks are incubating their
eggs. The uplands, formerly prairie, now are used partly for cultivated
crops and partly for pasture. The soil is poor and rocky, and
now heavily eroded. The pastures mostly have a weedy type of
vegetation indicative of overgrazing. Five-lined skinks are absent
from most of this upland.</p>

<p>The steep slopes from the upland to the valley floor are now
mostly wooded, and the population of skinks is chiefly in this band
of woodland. Some of the hillsides that have relatively gentle
slopes are treeless and are used for pasture, or are even under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
cultivation. Where second growth forest is present its aspect differs
depending upon slope, exposure, and past treatment. Osage orange
and honey locust are aggressive invaders on some dry hillside pastures,
and in this type of woods the skinks are scarce or absent. Some
hillside areas, especially on moist north slopes have thick second-growth
woods, in which elm is usually the principal tree, with several
oaks and hickories, walnut, hackberry, coffee tree, locust and
osage orange, and with a dense understory vegetation of dogwood,
gooseberry and coralberry, with vine tangles of grape, poison oak,
and greenbrier. Such woodlands provide little food for livestock,
and are often fenced off from adjacent pastures. The shading
creates conditions unfavorable for skinks and they are relatively
scarce in the denser woods. They are much more numerous in
woodlands that are fenced in with pastures heavily grazed by cattle
or horses, with understory vegetation kept cropped back, and with
more open ground and patches of sunlight. However, they are
absent or scarce in woods that have been subjected over periods of
years to browsing, by sheep or goats, so heavily that hardly any
herbaceous vegetation remains and so heavily that the soil is packed
from trampling. Along the upper slopes, especially about heads
of gullies, in areas strewn with flat rocks, in fairly open mixed woods,
with some decaying wood on the ground, habitat conditions are
most nearly optimum for the skinks. Artificial habitat features, such
as rock piles, stone walls, wood piles, rail fences, or old deserted
buildings and sheds, with loose boards lying about on the ground
may support unusually high concentrations of skinks when the surrounding
habitat is favorable.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Study Areas</h3>

<p>The University of Kansas Natural History Reservation where
most of the field work for this study was done, has been described
in a recent publication (Fitch 1952:8). While records were obtained
from scattered points throughout the 590-acre Reservation
and elsewhere in northeastern Kansas, field study of this skink was
concentrated on four relatively small areas totalling only about ten
acres in extent (<a href="#fig26">Figure 26</a>). These areas were selected on the basis
of abundance and availability of the skinks, and of variety of habitat
conditions represented.</p>

<p>One of these sites was a deserted quarry on a southward projecting
spur of the plateau-like cuesta top, where the upper layers of
the Oread limestone are prominently exposed. In the course of
operations, begun about 1937, the area was denuded of trees and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
shrubs, and the upper layers of limestone were removed from a strip
about 50 feet wide and more than 100 yards long. The exposed outcrop
presented a vertical rock face five to ten feet high, with south
and southeast exposure. Numerous jagged seams and fissures in
the rock hastened its disintegration. Quarrying had been discontinued
several years before the present study was begun in 1948.
At that time there were talus-like accumulations of rock and soil
several feet wide along the base of the rock face, supporting a
luxuriant pioneer vegetation especially, sweet clover, stickleaf, ragweed
and elm seedlings.</p>

<p>The habitat conditions provided by the exposed rock outcrop at
the border of woods and open land, proved unusually favorable for
reptiles in general, and it was one of the most productive sites on
the Reservation for Sonoran skinks, collared lizards, racerunners,
ring-necked snakes, blue-racers, bull snakes, pilot blacksnakes, scarlet
king snakes, slender tantillas, copperheads, and timber rattlesnakes.
For the five-lined skink, however, this disturbed area was
marginal, and supported only a sparse population. Several decaying
two-inch boards were preferred hiding places where the skinks
were found most frequently, and remains of collapsed rock walls,
one in the center of the area and one at the edge of the woods, were
also occupied. Skinks may have tended to wander away to more
favorable situations or may have been more subject to predation
than those elsewhere, since the incidence of recaptures was relatively
low. Most of the records from this general area were from
a ledge in adjacent woods rather than from the quarry itself.
Another site was a rock fill in a ravine below a pond made in 1937.
This rock fill was 70 feet long, up to 30 feet wide, and three feet
deep. East and north of the rock pile was a grassy dike, and beyond
it the pond. On the west open grassland extended approximately
200 feet to the edge of the woods, with a diversion ditch at
its border. On the south end, the rock pile was adjacent to woodland
at the base of a steep slope with north exposure. On this
slope the dense stand of second growth oak and hickory with an almost
continuous leaf canopy was a poor habitat. The rock pile was
thus partly isolated and surrounded by areas that were either uninhabitable
to the skinks or supported only sparse populations of them.
By 1948 the rock pile was partly covered by grape vines. Dead
leaves and other debris had accumulated in the deeper interstices
between the rocks. Spiders, beetles, snails and other small animals
were extremely numerous in the vicinity of the rock pile and provided
an abundant food supply. A large sycamore on the west side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of the rocks provided some afternoon shade. This rock pile provided
shelter for reptiles other than the five-lined skink&mdash;especially
the garter snake, water snake, copperhead, and brown skink.
Another area of about two and a fourth acres (&ldquo;Skink Woods,&rdquo; <a href="#fig21">Figure
21</a>) was the one most productive of skinks. It is a wooded upper
slope adjacent to a hilltop pasture. Along the hilltop rim the upper
stratum of the Oread limestone presents a rock face as much as four
feet high at the north end, but less exposed at the south end where
it was partly covered by deposited soil. Approximately 100 feet
down the slope a second outcropping is present, with many loose
rocks and boulders throughout the whole area. Soil is light and
loamy. The slope has a west exposure. The stand of trees is fairly
open, with several large elms, walnuts, and yellow oaks, and occasional
hackberries, ailanthus and red haws. This area was included
in a narrow strip of woodland fenced about 1940 as a runway connecting
a hilltop pasture with a valley pasture where water was
available at a time when both pastures were heavily grazed by
horses and cattle. As a result of trampling, browsing and grazing by
livestock, understory vegetation of this area presented a different
aspect from that in most other parts of the woodland. Saplings of
the dominant tree species and shrubs, notably dogwood, gooseberry
and crabapple, were relatively scarce. Herbaceous vegetation, especially
muhly grass, was conspicuous. By 1953 in the fifth growing
season after livestock were removed, the area still contrasted with
other parts of the woodland in sparseness of shrubby vegetation.
Old stock trails were still discernible, and some sheet erosion and
gullying had occurred. The effect of livestock in holding back
woody undergrowth seemed to be an important factor in improving
the habitat as the skinks were much scarcer in adjacent woodlands
on either side that were similar in species composition, size, and
numbers of the larger trees, but different in having much thicker
underbrush. These adjacent woodlands were not entirely comparable,
however, because they had more north-facing exposures.
Reptile associates in the Skink Woods area include the brown
skink, Sonoran skink, glass-snake, worm snake, ring-necked snake,
blue-racer, garter snake, pilot blacksnake, copperhead and timber
rattlesnake, but only the worm snake and ring-necked snake were
abundant.</p>

<p>Rat Woods, an area of approximately four acres, was like Skink
Woods, formerly the upper part of a connecting strip between hilltop
and valley pastures and was altered by the effect of concentrated
trampling and browsing by livestock. It is V-shaped, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the apex at the north end, and the slope exposures southwest and
southeast. The area is bisected from north to south by a small
gully, and remains of an old rock wall. To the east of this gully
the lower outcrop is prominent but west of the gully, it is but little
developed. As compared with other wooded areas, this one was
relatively dry. Trees, and other vegetation in general, are somewhat
more xeric in aspect than are those in Skink Woods. Along
the upper ledge are elms and hackberries, with many thick clumps
of fragrant sumac. The trees are mainly elm, walnut, honey locust,
and osage orange with hardly any oaks or hickories and, with
shrubby undergrowth of dogwood, gooseberry, and coralberry
sparser than in adjacent woodlands. Herbaceous vegetation consists
largely of muhly grass, geum, and avens. On the hilltop edge
above the ledge are many flat rocks of varying sizes, and the slope
is thickly strewn with rocks, some of the larger ones deeply embedded
in the soil. The population of five-lined skinks was relatively
sparser than in Skink Woods. Other reptiles including the
Sonoran skink, racerunner, glass-snake, worm snake, ring-necked
snake, blue-racer, bull snake, pilot blacksnake, garter snake, scarlet
king snake, slender tantilla, and copperhead, were more numerous
in this area than in most other parts of the Reservation. The comparatively
scarce prairie skink was found only in this area, and the
scarlet king snake and slender tantilla were found only here and at
the quarry.</p>


<h2>The Annual Cycle of Reproduction and Growth</h2>

<h3 class="smcap">Seasonal Occurrence</h3>

<p>Collectors and other observers have often noted that reptiles, in
general, are not found in equal abundance throughout the entire
season of their activity. Many kinds are most in evidence within
a period of weeks after emergence from hibernation, which corresponds
with the time of breeding and later they become much
scarcer. In skinks of the genus <i>Eumeces</i> this tendency is perhaps
even more pronounced than in most other kinds of reptiles. By
midsummer or considerably earlier their period of greatest activity
is passed, and in some kinds, adults, or individuals of any size can
rarely be found in the latter half of the growing season, even by a
skilled collector familiar with their habitats and habits. Thus,
Taylor (1936:5) in the preface of his revision of <i>Eumeces</i>, describing
the difficulties involved in assembling needed series of the
many Mexican species by collecting on summer field trips, wrote:
"In 1934 in western Mexico &#8230; I met with most disheartening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
results &#8230; (although more than 1500 specimens were
collected) only a single specimen of <i>Eumeces</i> was taken. Hobart
Smith, in 1934, accompanied by David Dunkle, made a journey
into northwestern Mexico &#8230; and while generally successful,
likewise obtained only a single specimen of <i>Eumeces</i>."</p>

in 1949, 1950, 1951, and 1952; adult males and adult females are taken in
greatest numbers in May, and in progressively smaller numbers through the
summer and autumn; yearlings are found in increasing numbers through March,
April, May, and June, then in decreasing numbers through the summer and
autumn.</p>
</div>

<p>In the present study the tendency of <i>E. fasciatus</i> to concentrate
its surface activity in early spring was clearly shown. In unseasonably
warm weather in early spring, even in February in one instance,
individual skinks have been found active on the surface or
beneath flat rocks warmed by the sun; but general emergence
ordinarily does not occur until sometime in April, depending on
the weather. Unless the weather is much warmer than the seasonal
norm, the skinks spend much of April in a torpid condition,
either not becoming fully active until late in the month, or
lapsing into torpidity with the return of cool weather after their
first emergence from hibernation. During warm periods in April,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
however, activity is at or near its annual maximum for all individuals
regardless of sex or age.</p>

<p>In May, with the advent of much warmer weather, daytime temperatures
are usually high enough for the skinks to be active. Adult
males travel about more actively and persistently than females or
young, and as a result they are found so much more frequently
that the numbers taken approximate those for adult females and
young combined. Many of the adult males recorded in May were
taken in funnel traps or pitfalls. Active males in the open were
difficult to catch, and a high percentage of them escaped. To the
casual collector or observer, these skinks are much more in evidence
in May than at any other time of year, and most of those seen are
adult males. By June, the numbers of skinks seen in the open decline
abruptly. The adult males become relatively scarce, with
reduction from more than half to about one-sixth of the total, and
the young, about half-grown at that season, make up approximately
half of the total. The adult females make up approximately one-third
of the total June sample, but few of them were found active
on the ground surface. Most were found in nest burrows beneath
flat rocks. Under such conditions they tended to be sluggish in
behavior, and were caught much more easily than were males and
young. July was characterized by progressive decrease in the numbers
of adult males, adult females, and second year young, whereby
the numbers of each group were little more than half of those for
June; and by appearance of a new crop of hatchlings which made
up about one-third of the month&rsquo;s sample. Hatchlings first appeared
from early July to late July in different years; few were recorded
in July in some years. Females were much less commonly found
in nests in July than in June because many nesting attempts were
terminated before the beginning of July or early in the month, and
probably because those that remained were often more deeply
buried and better concealed. By August the adult males, and the
second year young (by then approaching adult size) were found
in still smaller numbers, but the number of hatchlings and of adult
females approximated those recorded in July. In the females there
is evidently some resumption of activity after the incubation period
is terminated. The females are then hungry and sometimes emaciated,
weighing less, on the average, than the year-old young of
shorter snout-vent length. The numbers of hatchlings are augmented
through early August in some years, as late broods continue
to hatch. By early September few skinks except hatchlings are to
be found, and activity continues to wane throughout the month.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
In October skinks of any age or sex group are a rarity, even though
temperature is about the optimum for their activity. Little is
known concerning where and how they spend the fall months.
Probably they are not actually dormant, but retreat underground
where temperature is moderate and humidity is high. Individuals
kept in captivity at this season were listless showing but little inclination
to feed. The only five-lined skink taken on the Reservation
in November was found in a funnel trap after a rain at the end
of a long drought. It may have been attracted to the surface by
moisture.</p>

<p>The following table shows the dates on which various events of
the annual cycle were observed in each of five different years.
Owing, to the secretive habits of the skinks, these events generally
were not observed until somewhat after their earliest occurrence in
any one season. The lag was greater in some instances than in
others.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Sexual Cycles and Behavior</h3>

<p>Reynolds (1943:370 and 1947:191) studied the histological and
gross seasonal changes in the reproductive organs of the adult male
<i>Eumeces fasciatus</i>. There is a well defined annual cycle. "Early
seasonal increase in seminiferous epithelial heights and in diameter
of lumina and tubules reached a maximum in April followed by
regression reaching complete involution by August. Late seasonal
revival of activity results, by November, in size of testicular elements
comparable to those seen in January. Primary spermatocytes
predominate in the germinal epithelium in January, secondary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
spermatocytes and spermatids in February, with spermatids and
metamorphosing sperm dominating from March until late June when
the germinal material of the current season is exhausted." Fifty-three
adult males were used as a basis for his study. These were of
diverse origins from Arkansas, Florida, Missouri, Tennessee, and
Indiana. Since sexual cycles in such widely ranging species tend
to be synchronized with local phenology, and change somewhat
from one region to another, the seasonal cycle may have been somewhat
obscured by the diverse origins of the material. The Florida
specimens may have been of the species <i>E. inexpectatus</i>. Apparently
Reynolds&rsquo; experimental skinks were kept in captivity for varying
lengths of time before their reproductive organs were examined.
The normal cycle would almost certainly be altered in captivity,
especially in skinks kept at high temperatures during the time that
they would normally be hibernating.</p>

<p>The seasonal change in gross appearance of the testes is not great.
In the breeding season the testes are slightly enlarged and are firm
and engorged, with pinkish or orange tinge. In immature males,
and adults that are not in breeding condition, the testes are smaller,
attenuate, paler colored, and flaccid. Sizes of testes in some males
killed in the breeding season are recorded in <a href="#Table_4">Table 4</a>.</p>

<p>From the time of emergence in spring, males show some tendency
to seek out females, and frequently a pair may be found together
under the same rock, weeks before the onset of the breeding season.
There is no satisfactory evidence that such associations have any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
permanence. At the time of emergence from hibernation the males
rarely have even a trace of reddish coloration on their heads, and
more than a month normally elapses before attainment of breeding
coloration. Each year that observations were made activity of the
skinks was interrupted by cold weather in April, so that the lizards
were fully active for only part of the time between their earliest
emergence and their attainment of breeding condition five to eight
weeks later. The reddish suffusion of the breeding season, hardly
showing in the first few weeks after emergence, appears suddenly
within a few days in all adult males of the population. The best
indication of the time necessary to attain breeding condition was
provided by an adult male whose hibernation was interrupted on
December 15 by bringing him into a warm room where he was kept
at 80&#176; F. or more in the daytime, and approximately 70&#176; F. at night.
Thirteen days later, on December 28, the male had developed a
noticeable reddish suffusion. On January 3, nineteen days after
hibernation terminated, the suffusion was near its maximum. When
an adult female was placed with the male on this date, he showed
sexual interest but the courtship was not consummated. On January
6, the 22nd day, the male&rsquo;s colors had reached their maximum, and
when the female was placed with him, pursuit and copulation
occurred promptly.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1952, the first skink of the season was found on
March 29, still only partly activated, and under a large flat rock.
Skinks were not caught or seen in any numbers until April 17, however,
and general emergence probably occurred only a day or two
earlier than this. On May 10, 1952, breeding activity was estimated
to be at its peak. By May 28, the reddish suffusion was conspicuously
faded in several males taken. By June 10 it was no longer
discernible.</p>

<p>In the immature female the oviducts are small and threadlike,
and the ovaries have grapelike clusters of pale whitish eggs, which
are minute, often less than .5 mm. in diameter (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8A</a>). In
sexually mature females ova enlarge rapidly after emergence from
hibernation in the spring. While eggs are still in the ovary, they
are approximately spherical. In late April and early May the developing
ova enlarge rapidly. Approximate average sizes (dimensions
in mm.) of developing ovarian ova in each of 22 mature
females on different dates were as follows: April 17, 1949: 2.6, 2.3,
2.2, 2.2, 1.9, 1.9; April 18, 1949: 2.2, 1.9, 1.8, 1.1, 1.1; April 24, 1949:
4.6, 3.2, 2.5, 2.3; May 6, 1951: 2.5, 2.3; May 20, 1951: 7.0, 6.2; May
25, 1951: 8.0; June 3, 1951: 6.0, 5.5.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>The two females containing ovarian eggs on June 3, 1951, were
retarded individuals, taken along with several others that had already
ovulated. Copulation takes place in early May before the
ova have grown to their full size. In the following weeks both the
ova and the oviducts enlarge rapidly. Upon passing into the oviducts,
the ova assume an oval shape and are approximately 9 by 6
mm. before the albumen and shell are added. Deposition of a
clutch of eggs probably extends over only a day or two at most, as
clutches appear abruptly in the nest cavities. On only a few occasions
were the females found in nest cavities with their clutches
partly laid.</p>

<p>Sexual behavior is for the most part limited to a short period of
weeks in spring. In an average year in the area of the study the
first two weeks of May would include the peak and the greater part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of the breeding season. The &ldquo;courtship,&rdquo; such as it is, and mating
have been described by many observers. However none of the
published accounts seems to include all the essential features in
their usual sequence as observed in the present study. It has been
brought out by the studies of Noble and Bradley (1933:94), Noble
and Teale (1930:54) and Schmidt (1933:71-76) that the sexual
behavior of lizards has phylogenetic significance. Certain basic
patterns in mating behavior are characteristic of saurian families,
other traits are characteristic of genera, while certain details may
be characteristic of species, or perhaps even of subspecies.</p>

<p>In the breeding season the adult male directs the greater part of
his activities to a search for females, and finds them by both sight
and scent. Observations on searching males suggest that they trail
females by scent to some extent, or at least detect their presence
in the general vicinity by this means. Upon discovering a female,
the male pursues her with vigor and determination unless the temperature
is too low, or unless he is not at the height of breeding
condition. The female makes no positive response but reacts to
the male&rsquo;s presence by fleeing, either frantically or perfunctorily,
but if she is physiologically ready to breed the reaction is usually
somewhat intermediate between these extremes. The first reaction
of the male as he approaches the female is to touch her with his
tongue, apparently receiving olfactory stimuli which are essential
to the mating pattern. Rushing in pursuit of the female he then
attempts to seize her in his jaws. Most often a preliminary grasp
is secured on the female&rsquo;s tail. The female may resist vigorously,
wriggling and clawing, turning upon the male to bite or to threaten
with her gaping jaws. At the first opportunity the male deftly
shifts his grip from the female&rsquo;s tail or hindquarters to a more
anterior position, which may be as far forward as the forelimbs or
may be as much as an inch behind them, a little to one side of the
mid-dorsal line. The male secures his hold by pinching loose skin
into a small fold. Having gained this position the male is more or
less out of reach of the female&rsquo;s jaws, and after a brief struggle both
rest quietly except for their rapid breathing, usually for a minute
or more, the ventral surface of the male resting on the female&rsquo;s
dorsal surface. The male suddenly thrusts his tail beneath that of
the female. His hind leg then rests over the base of her tail and
the right angle formed by the laterally projecting hind leg and the
tail in each lizard aids to guide their hindquarters into position
so that cloacal contact is established. Copulation then begins immediately.
The male&rsquo;s body may be bent in a semicircle, to one
side of the female, or may be in an S-shaped loop, depending on
whether or not the hemipenis employed is on the side opposite to
that on which the female is grasped. Only one hemipenis is inserted,
but occasionally the other may be everted also. As copulation
begins the male&rsquo;s hind leg, flexed over the female&rsquo;s tail base
quivers, but otherwise there is hardly any movement during approximately
the first one-third of the copulatory period, and this
phase may last for from one to three minutes. Then, abruptly,
the male begins rhythmic, jerky flexions of the proximal portion of
the tail, at the rate of approximately one per second. These tail
movements are in a dorsoventral plane, and there is no perceptible
movement of the body. Shortly after these movements cease, contact
is broken usually at the initiative of the female, as she suddenly
struggles to escape and is released either immediately or after a
few seconds by the male. She then moves away, pressing her
cloacal region against the ground. Her movements have become
unhurried, with little or no attempt to avoid the male&rsquo;s attention.
The male usually follows, either close behind, or straddling the
female&rsquo;s tail or body. He may nip at her tail or body repeatedly,
but without securing a grip. When the female pauses, he may
come to rest with his chin or forequarters resting on her. Usually
the association does not last more than a few minutes.</p>

<p>Noble and Bradley (1933:77) mention frequent homosexual
matings between captive males. However, I observed no homosexual
matings, either under natural conditions or in confinement.
The pugnacious behavior of males that are in breeding condition
ordinarily would prevent homosexual mating. Males in such weakened
condition as to be unable to defend themselves effectively
might evoke sexual attack, instead of the usual fighting response in
other males. Although no actual experiments were performed in
the present study in connection with the courtship and mating behavior,
accounts of some workers seem misleading. My own observations
indicate that the capacity for sex discrimination in this
particular kind of lizard, and probably in others, has been underrated.
For example, it has been stated that the male rushes with
open mouth at the neck of any other skink that happens to be
around, and he identifies it as a male if it fights back, or as a female
if it does not. On the contrary my observations indicate that sex
recognition occurs almost as soon as the male is aware of another
skink&rsquo;s presence. The red head of the breeding male is an excellent
example of a social releaser in the sense that this term was
used by Tinbergen (1948:8). Like the red belly of the breeding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
male stickleback, it facilitates sex recognition and evokes hostile
behavior on the part of other males. Courtship, mating, and fighting
reactions however, seem to be evoked by the interaction of a
complex of social releasers. Whereas males and females are strikingly
different in appearance in the breeding season, visual sex
recognition is complicated by ontogenetic changes. The body
stripes characteristic of the female pattern, become dull or even
disappear in some old females, which then approximate the typical
male pattern. On the other hand newly matured males in their
first breeding season retain distinct body stripes of the female pattern.
Their sex is evidenced mainly by their reddish facial suffusion,
which is not quite so extensively developed as it is in older
individuals. Also, in these newly matured males the temporal region
is not so swollen as it is in old males.</p>

<p>The male whose dormancy was terminated in early winter by
bringing him into a warm room causing him to assume breeding
coloration and to breed some four months earlier than those under
natural conditions has already been mentioned. By the time the
regular breeding season arrived, this male had long since undergone
sexual regression and retained no trace of the red suffusion. In
this condition, placed in a terrarium with a mixed group of breeding
adults, his social status was of unusual interest. He exhibited
no interest in the females and was less pugnacious toward other
males than were the individuals in breeding condition. Although
he seemed somewhat more nervous and timid, his hostile behavior
was not entirely suppressed, as from time to time he moved up to
other males and bit them viciously. His color pattern resembled
those of certain old adult females in which the body stripes have
been suppressed, but the breeding males evidenced no uncertainty
as to his sex and were uniformly hostile. Their reactions were not
noticeably different toward him than they were toward breeding
males. The importance of an olfactory stimulus as a social releaser
in sexual behavior of lizards has not been appreciated, although
Noble and Mason (1933:10) did demonstrate its importance
in the behavior of the female toward her eggs.</p>

<p>It is evident from published accounts, and from my own limited
experience with <i>fasciatus</i> in parts of its range other than northeastern
Kansas, that the phenology of the breeding cycle is subject to
geographic variation, synchronizing with the somewhat different
climatic conditions under which the species occurs. However, the
difference is less than might be expected, in view of the species&rsquo;
extensive range. As a result of the early spring, and the warm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
summer climate in the southern states, dates of laying and hatching
may be several weeks advanced. On April 12, 1952, Dr. Wilfred
T. Neill showed me several live <i>E. fasciatus,</i> collected a few
days before along the Trinity River in southeastern Texas, which
appeared to be at the height of breeding condition. In northeastern
Kansas on that date, general emergence had not yet occurred,
and it was not until about May 10 that the population attained the
peak of breeding condition. On May 8, 1948, near Burr Ferry,
Vernon Parish, Louisiana, I caught an adult female in her nest
burrow, and she contained eggs ready to be laid. Data with which
Mr. Robert Gordon kindly provided me for specimens from southern
Louisiana and southeastern Texas, in the Tulane University collection,
indicate gravid females on June 4, 1952, and June 17, 1948
(3), and females with their egg clutches on June 16, 1948, June 17,
1948, June 23, 1950; and hatching dates in captivity of July 19, 1949,
July 19, 1950, July 25-26, 1949. These dates correspond well with
those for specimens obtained in northeastern Kansas in the same
years. In the northern part of the range, Ruthven (1911:264)
recorded that in the Saginaw Bay region, females taken on June 19
had eggs nearly ready to be laid, and after July 2 clutches were
found frequently; young of the year were first observed on July
31. A juvenal specimen in the University of Minnesota Natural
History Museum, collected on August 11, 1938, at Dresser Junction,
Wisconsin, is 30<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> mm. in snout-vent length&mdash;approximately
the size of juveniles in northeastern Kansas at the same season.
Evans and Roecker (1951:6) record hatching as occurring in the
first week of September at Arden, Ontario, indicating that at the
northern edge of the range hatching may be delayed as much as
two months. With such delayed hatching, but little time remains
for the young to grow before they are forced into retirement for
hibernation.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Fighting</h3>

<p>Territoriality in the usual sense is lacking in the five-lined skink,
and could scarcely exist in an animal of its habits. To defend a
definite area (territory) against intruders of its own species, the
animal would have to detect such intruders promptly. The skink,
however, is so secretive in habits that at any given time the individual
is likely to be hiding and inactive, even when conditions are
favorable for it to be in the open, and other individuals therefore
can then wander onto its home range unopposed. Even when an
individual is active, it lacks the ability to detect others, except
within a radius which would encompass only a small fraction of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the entire home range. The senses are inadequate to inform one
lizard of the presence of another until the two are only a few yards,
or even a few inches apart. Usually the lizard is on the ground,
where even small objects obstruct its view, and vision is probably
effective for only a few yards. Hearing is probably effective for
about the same radius in detecting animals of approximately its
own size. Scent is effective in detecting prey near at hand or on
contact, but probably does not serve for detection of other lizards
that are not in the immediate vicinity. Therefore, the area covered
by one in the course of its normal activities may harbor many others,
and individuals most of the time are unaware of the others on their
home ranges.</p>

<p>Under most circumstances these skinks behave toward each other
with tolerance or indifference, but during the breeding season adult
males become hostile, and fight on sight. Their reddish facial suffusion
serves as a social releaser which elicits hostile behavior and
facilitates sex recognition. As the breeding season wanes, the reddish
suffusion fades rapidly and male hostility, probably controlled
by the same hormonal complex, is likewise suppressed. Hostile behavior
is rare in adult females or young at any time.</p>

<p>Combats and pursuits have been observed most frequently the
last week of April and especially in the first two weeks of May. At
this season funnel traps set along rock ledges often caught two
adult male skinks together. In almost every instance one of the two
confined males was mutilated, with pieces of skin and flesh bitten
from the tail and with chin, snout, and neck scarred; most serious
wounds were usually in the sacral region or base of the tail or both.
Often the wounds were so severe that the skink died in a short
time in captivity and presumably others that were released died also.</p>

<div class="smaller">
<p>On April 28, 1949, a large adult male skink, chased by another, ran out
in the middle of a trail and stopped. The pursuer stopped a few inches from
it, then after a long pause, retreated in the direction from which it had come.
For the five minutes that the pursued skink was watched, it lay motionless,
partly hidden by dry leaves, evidently seeking to avoid further pursuit by concealment.
I caught it without difficulty, and it seemed weak and dazed, as if
injured in the fight. Its reddish suffusion was conspicuous, but not fully
developed.</p>

<p>On May 3, 1949, an adult male having bright red facial suffusion was observed
searching persistently in ground litter; he was seen to find and pursue
a female, and to copulate. A few minutes after mating was completed and the
pair separated, a second male also searching in the vicinity came within sight
of the first one. The two noticed each other at a distance of about 18 inches,
indicating their awareness by their more alert, jerky movements, and spasmodic
vibrating of their tails. The newcomer darted at the other, and for a moment
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
they dodged and sparred. As one broke away to run, the other seized it by the
tail. They were on an exposed tree root about an inch in diameter. The skink
that was caught twisted its body around underneath the root and seized its
adversary by the tail likewise, so that their linked bodies encircled the root,
each squirming to disengage itself from the other&rsquo;s jaws. After a few seconds
they did break apart, and then maneuvered briefly menacing each other at close
quarters, but they gradually moved away and lost contact.</p>

<p>On May 10, 1949, two adult males were seen to approach each other slowly,
pausing for perhaps a minute when they were a little more than one foot apart.
Then one edged up to the other, and with a sudden lunge seized it by the head.
The one seized broke away with a vigorous jerk, and promptly retaliated by
biting the first one&rsquo;s head. After a few seconds of rapid sparring and thrashing,
they broke apart, and one chased the other for several feet until it eluded further
pursuit by dodging and hiding.</p>
</div>

grip on the attacker, and must break away by violent thrashing.</p>
</div>

<div class="smaller">
<p>On May 12, 1950, my attention was attracted by a rustling in dry leaves.
Within a few inches of my foot two adult males were struggling fiercely with
jaws interlocked. Sudden violent twisting and thrashing alternated with quiet
periods of a few seconds duration, in which the lizards scarcely moved except
for heavy panting and twitching of their tails. After perhaps two minutes of
fighting, one broke away and ran. For a distance of several feet it was closely
pursued by the other, which, however, soon lost contact with it in the rough
terrain and surface litter.</p>

<p>On May 12, 1951, rustling in dry leaves attracted my attention to two large
adult males fighting. For about fifteen minutes that they were observed, they
struggled, with neither yielding ground, though they thrashed and rolled about
over an area of several square feet. Sometimes they were disengaged for short
intervals. Then facing in opposite directions, with their heads side by side,
they would snap at each other&rsquo;s necks and shoulders (<a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>). Part of the
time both males had grips and were biting each other simultaneously, but more
frequently one or the other had a temporary advantage. When one secured a
grip it would strain to the utmost, biting as hard as it could and lunging forward
with frequent short jerks, meanwhile striving to keep out of reach of the
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
other&rsquo;s jaws. The one caught in the attacker&rsquo;s grip was usually unable to flex
its body sharply enough to reach its opponent at all, or could barely reach it
at such an oblique angle that its jaws slipped off the smooth body. Sometimes
the one held did succeed in catching the other&rsquo;s front foot. The one caught in
the other&rsquo;s jaws always succeeded in tearing loose after a short time. In the
interval while the attacker rested with jaws partly relaxed, the victim had an
opportunity to break away. Even when both were free, they did not obtain
grips easily, but often made several unsuccessful lunges and bites, the jaws of
each slipping off the firm, smooth sides of its opponent. Sometimes the attacker
seized a fold of skin, or sometimes obtained a wide grip on its body. One
which had obtained a grip sometimes rolled rapidly, spinning the other around
and dashing it against the ground. As these rotations stopped, the victim might
come to rest on its back in such a position that it was temporarily helpless, but
always broke loose after further struggles. Neither showed any inclination to
retreat until finally, when they were interlocked, rolling about almost at my
feet, I attempted to catch them. Then they instantly disengaged and rushed
away, and one escaped. The one caught had suffered but little injury in the
fight. Numerous tooth marks were discernible as minute abrasions on the surface
of the scales, but the bony dermal armor had not been perceptibly penetrated
during the prolonged and violent struggle.</p>
</div>


<h3 class="smcap">Eggs</h3>

<p>The eggs of <i>Eumeces fasciatus</i> are like diminutive chicken eggs in
appearance. They are white when first laid, slightly translucent
when held to the light. Within a day or two after they are laid,
these eggs are soiled to a dull tan color, somewhat mottled, as a
result of being rolled and dragged about in contact with the floor
and wall of the nest burrow. Like the eggs of most other reptiles,
those of <i>Eumeces fasciatus</i> have parchmentlike shells. These shells
are thin and easily punctured. As incubation proceeds, the egg
enlarges by gradual absorption of moisture and the somewhat elastic
shell is stretched. An egg left in water for as much as a day does
not gain in weight appreciably. Except for occasional abnormal
ones, the eggs of any one clutch are notably uniform in size and
shape at the time they are laid. As incubation proceeds, some eggs
enlarge more rapidly than others, and attain larger ultimate size.
Differences in shape also appear, some eggs becoming relatively
elongate and thin, while others are thick and blunt. Some become
distorted to asymmetrical shapes. In nests that have been deserted
by the females, eggs of irregular shape are especially noticeable.
It seems probable that the frequent shifting of the eggs by the
female prevents unequal drying or stretching in different areas of
the shell. Normal young were observed to hatch from grossly misshapen
eggs. Under conditions of drought, the eggs may not enlarge
normally during the latter part of incubation, and may become
indented or partly collapsed, and yet apparently normal young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
hatch from them. Both in the field, and in laboratory experiments,
eggs were found to have remarkable tolerance for excess moisture.
After heavy rains of summer thunderstorms, nests were sometimes
found to have water trickling through them, and on occasion eggs
were found to be partly submerged in water in the nest cavity. Exposed
rocks at the heads of small gullies often were chosen by the
female skinks as the shelter for their nests. In these situations the
nests were exposed to run-off water. In July, 1951, especially, unusually
heavy precipitation resulted in the flooding of many nests.
In some instances desertion by the females and destruction of the
eggs seemed to have been caused by this flooding, even in the well-drained
hillside situations where this study was made.</p>

<div class="smaller">
<p>The extent of tolerance to immersion in water probably depends on the stage
of development, the temperature, the oxygen content of the water and other
factors. One egg was fully immersed for ten minutes on July 20, 1951, then
returned to a container with damp soil in the laboratory, where it seemed to
develop normally. On July 30 it was opened and found to have a living fetus,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
which was a week short of hatching. On July 22 another egg of the same
clutch was immersed and left in water for 23 hours. On July 30 it was ruptured
in handling and found to contain a living fetus. On July 31 two eggs were
placed in a dish of water in a refrigerator. On August 5 they were removed
and opened. Fetuses were dead and were not appreciably larger than the one
of the same clutch in the egg opened on July 31. On August 5 two of the remaining
eggs of this clutch were placed in a Petri dish, partly immersed in
water, with approximately one-fourth of the surface of each protruding and
exposed to the air. Forty-eight hours later it was found that both eggs had
hatched. Evaporation had reduced the water in the dish to an amount sufficient
to cover only about the lower one-third of each egg. One hatchling was
missing, evidently having climbed out of the shallow dish and escaped to the
floor. The other was found still standing in the water with its head protruding,
and it was lively and in good condition. The remaining four eggs in this clutch,
which had been kept in a container of damp earth, were also hatching on this
date. On July 10, 1952, an egg in a late stage of incubation was immersed in
water in the laboratory. On July 14 when removed, it had fungus growing on
it, and was found to have a dead fetus, nearly full-sized.</p>
</div>

<p>The range of temperature tolerance of the embryo is wide, probably
comparable to that of the adult. Time required for incubation
is dependent on temperature. Persistently wet and cloudy weather
in the summer of 1951, keeping temperatures relatively low in nests,
was a contributing cause to late hatching that summer. As compared
with 1952, hatching was about one month delayed in 1951,
but later emergence and breeding accounts for part of the difference.
The extent to which low temperature may delay incubation
was indicated by the effect of refrigeration on several experimental
eggs, as recorded below.</p>

<p>These experiments seem to show that, in the later stages of incubation
at least, lowering of temperature to 11&#176; or 12&#176;C. almost halts
development of the fetus. Harm does not necessarily result, however,
and when again warmed to normal incubation temperatures,
the eggs eventually hatch, the incubation period being lengthened
by a time approximately equivalent to the interval of refrigeration.</p>

<p>Under natural conditions the time required for incubation probably
varies within wide limits, controlled mainly by temperature.
No two clutches receive the same amount of heat, as sites differ
greatly in extent of insulation, and exposure to sunlight. Each
year, earliest appearance of hatchlings is in a warm, sunny situation,
and in cooler, well shaded places hatchlings appear somewhat later.
Their incubation is evidently somewhat protracted, although later
emergence from hibernation and later breeding of adults in these
situations might also contribute to the delay.</p>

<p>Widely different incubation periods have been recorded in the
literature and the variation probably is not due to temperature alone.
Noble and Mason (1933:4) recorded incubation periods for six
females from the same locality, and evidently kept under the same
laboratory conditions, as 47, 41, 36, 29, 29, and 27 days. Despite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the wide difference in incubation time, all six clutches hatched
within a 12-day period from July 5-17. It seems improbable that
differences in temperature account for the 20-day disparity between
maximum and minimum incubation time, in these females kept
under similar conditions. Cagle (1940:229) recorded an even
shorter incubation period for one kept in the laboratory, which laid
eggs on June 30; hatching occurred on July 23 and 24. Retention
of eggs in the oviduct by females kept under unnatural conditions
would partly explain their late laying and the short incubation
period of their clutches. Such ability to retain eggs in the oviduct
while their development proceeds would not be especially surprising
in <i>E. fasciatus</i> since its congener <i>E. lynxe</i> of the highlands in southern
Mexico is normally ovoviviparous (Hartweg, 1931:61; Taylor,
1936:171). Cagle did not determine incubation time for any of the
natural nests found, but evidently in all of them laying occurred
earlier than in the single female brought to the laboratory while
still gravid. All the eggs in natural nests found by him were brought
to the laboratory and most of them were hatched. Cagle remarked:
&ldquo;The fact that these 26 nests hatched within a period of nine days
seemingly indicates that the egg laying period extends over not
more than two weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the present study no incubation periods so short as those recorded
by Noble and Mason, and Cagle, were observed. Incubation
times were recorded for clutches both in the laboratory and in
the field, but for most of the clutches only approximate incubation
periods were recorded. Failure to record the exact date of laying or
of hatching, or both resulted from attempts to avoid frequent disturbance
of females in their nests, which might have caused them to
desert.</p>

<div class="smaller">
<p>One clutch of eggs laid in a terrarium probably on June 17, 1951&mdash;possibly
a day or two earlier&mdash;hatched on July 30, after an incubation of about 44 days.
Another clutch, found in a terrarium on July 17, 1951, was estimated to have
been laid about a week earlier, judging from the average length (11.8 mm.)
and average weight (.55 gm.) of the eggs. These eggs hatched on August 9,
a little more than three weeks after their discovery. A clutch found in the
field on June 25, 1951, evidently recently laid (average length 12 mm., weight
.45 gm.), hatched 41 days later, on August 5. Another clutch found in a terrarium
on July 17, 1951, was estimated to have been laid ten days or two weeks
before, as the average length was 12.7 mm. The eggs hatched on August 7,
three weeks after their discovery. On June 25, 1951, an incomplete clutch of
three eggs was found with a female which still had an unlaid egg. The three
eggs probably had been laid the same day or the day before. They were kept
in the laboratory and weighed and measured at intervals until July 28, 33 days
after their discovery when both those that remained were accidentally punctured
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and found to have nearly full term fetuses. In the field a nest which
contained only a gravid female on June 24, 1951, had a clutch of eggs already
mud stained and slightly enlarged on June 29. The most probable date of
laying was June 26. On August 6 the eggs had all hatched but several young
were still in the nest. Probably most hatched on August 5. The incubation
time was hence approximately 40 days.</p>

<p>On June 21, 1951, a natural nest was found with eggs already somewhat enlarged
(12.5 &#215; 8 mm.) and mud stained. This nest was checked from time to
time in the next few weeks, and after 39 days, on July 30, it was found that
all the eggs had recently hatched, but six young were still in the nest cavity.</p>

<p>Another nest was found on June 24, 1951, with the eggs already markedly
enlarged (14 &#215; 8 mm.) indicating that laying must have been several days
earlier&mdash;probably well over a week. Hatching occurred approximately 34
days later, probably on July 28, since on July 26 there was no sign that hatching
was imminent, and on July 30 only the empty dried eggshells remained in
the nest.</p>
</div>

<p>The incubation time approximated six weeks for those nests with
most complete records. Under wet and stormy weather conditions
such as prevailed in 1951, this may have been the normal incubation
period, but in warmer and drier years incubation time is shortened.</p>

<p>In the five-lined skink each adult female normally produces one
clutch of eggs annually. The size of the clutch produced is subject
to individual variation, and is influenced by the age, size and condition
of the female. Geographic variation in clutch size might also
be expected. Data were obtained from breeding females killed and
dissected, from counts of eggs found in natural nests in the field, and
from clutches of eggs laid by females kept in captivity. For the
total of 115 recorded clutches represented by the combined data
from all these sources, the average number of eggs per clutch was
9.5.</p>

<p>In many females dissected for the purpose of obtaining egg
counts, ovulation had not yet occurred. The ovarian eggs present
in each of these females included two main size groups, the larger
ones in process of maturing and evidently destined for deposition
in the current season, and minute, immature ones. A few of intermediate
size were always present, however, resulting in uncertainty
as to the size of the clutch being produced, especially when development
had not proceeded far. Even when the larger eggs formed
a fairly distinct size group, some usually were well below maximum
size. Relatively high counts of clutches were obtained from these
examinations of enlarged ovarian eggs. Evidently development
frequently is arrested, and resorption may occur before ovulation.
As a result the numbers of ovarian eggs developing are a poor indication
of actual clutch size. A series of gravid females were obtained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and examined after ovulation; the numbers of eggs in their
oviducts probably indicates accurately the sizes of their clutches.
Gravid females taken from their nest burrows and kept in the laboratory
in containers with loose damp soil soon excavated new burrows
and deposited clutches. Many natural nests were found in the
field, and the egg counts obtained from them provided further data
concerning clutch size. Although most of these clutches probably
had their full complements of eggs, others certainly had sustained
losses to predators, or to the females themselves, which may eat
some of the eggs. Therefore the average number found is erroneously
low. Some of the natural nests found may have contained
two or more clutches or parts of them, and the higher counts obtained
from natural nests therefore are also questionable.</p>

<p>On the average, larger females produce more eggs per clutch
than do smaller females. Of 49 females for which measurements
were recorded, and which had uterine or large ovarian eggs, 31
were 70 mm. or more in snout-vent length. These 31, mostly or
entirely old adults, averaged 9.9 eggs per clutch, whereas 18 others
that were 69 mm. or less in snout-vent length, and that must have
been mainly or entirely newly matured adults in their first breeding
season, averaged only 7.8 eggs per clutch.</p>

<p>Smith (1946:350) states that in the northern part of the range
of this skink there is some indication of decrease in size of clutches.
This is not well shown by published records. For the southern
states, most of the published records of clutch size are by authors
who did not clearly distinguish between the three kinds of five-lined
skinks, and there is some doubt as to which species is involved
in each record. For 56 clutches reported upon from north
of approximately latitude 37&#176;, I obtain a slightly higher figure than
for 11 clutches from south of this line. Geographic trends are, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
course, obscured by individual variation, and perhaps by abnormal
clutches produced by individuals kept in captivity.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Table_7">Table 7</a>, the figures marked with asterisks pertain to clutches
that might have belonged to skinks of the species <i>E. laticeps</i> or
<i>E. inexpectatus</i> since they were recorded in regions where <i>laticeps</i>
and in some cases, <i>inexpectatus</i> also, occurs along with <i>fasciatus</i>.
If these questionable clutches are excluded the remaining 55,
definitely of <i>fasciatus</i>, average 8.48 eggs per clutch, whereas the
12 questionable clutches average 8.42. Both figures are close to
the average of 8.82 &#177; .32 eggs for the 34 natural nests recorded in
the present study. For the total of 1661 eggs of 182 clutches, from
the combined sample of all available records for clutches found in
the present study or reported upon in the literature, the average
egg number is 9.13.</p>

<p class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span> Correlation between size of female and number of eggs in clutch;
females in their first breeding season, mostly less than 72 mm. in snout-vent
length, produce smaller clutches, on the average, than do larger and older females,
but there is extensive overlap.</p>
</div>

<p>To sum up the available information on clutch size, the number
of eggs is most typically 9, 10, or 11 and is more in large old females,
than in small, newly matured females. In natural nests,
even in those that are successful, there is often some loss of eggs,
which are eaten by predators, or by the female herself, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
result that the egg counts made by various observers average somewhat
lower than the numbers actually produced. The loss during
incubation cannot be measured readily since it is almost certainly
sharply increased by the disturbance entailed in observing nests.
Exposing nests, even momentarily, for observation, may result in
compacting of the surrounding soil, desiccation, temporary or permanent
desertion by the female, and exposure to predation. Some
indication of the incidence of loss during incubation might be obtained
by counting and measuring the eggs in newly found nests

<h3 class="smcap">Brooding</h3>

<p>Lizards and snakes of several different families, are known to
brood their clutches of eggs, although the great majority of oviparous
forms do not do so. The brooding habit is perhaps best
known in <i>Eumeces fasciatus</i>, and has been described by many
authors. By far the most thorough account is that of Noble and
Mason (1933) who observed and experimented upon seven females
that laid clutches of eggs in captivity. These females, kept in separate
terraria, excavated nest burrows for reception of their
clutches, and remained with them throughout the time of incubation.
There were three characteristic brooding postures; curved
in a semicircle around the clutch, in an S-shaped figure extending
among them, or lying straight, either over or among the eggs. The
brooding females, taken quietly from their nests without disturbing
them, were found to have temperatures averaging .4&#176;C. higher
than the nests. Evidently normal room temperatures were maintained
in the laboratory where the terraria were kept. The females
occasionally left their nests, especially in late afternoon, to wander
about the terraria, and to bask in sunlight. While basking, their
temperatures averaged 2.7&#176;C. higher than the nest temperatures.
The authors suggested that an important function of the brooding
female was to transfer warmth from absorbed sunlight to the eggs.
They state: &ldquo;In nature the importance of the mother&rsquo;s body heat
in the incubation of the eggs probably varies greatly with the type
of nesting site selected.&rdquo; They suggest that in clutches deposited
in logs or stumps beneath a thin layer of bark exposed to direct
sunlight the need for warming by the female would be less.</p>

<p>My own observations do not support the idea that brooding by
the female serves to hasten the development of the eggs. Both in
the laboratory and in natural nests, clutches deserted by disturbed
females hatched and the hatching was not unduly delayed. In the
field, females were never observed to bask in the sun beside their
nest burrows, and seemingly left them infrequently even to feed.
When a female was caught in her nest burrow, her temperature
nearly always approximated that of the surrounding earth with
which she was in contact. The temperature in each nest depends
primarily upon its situation. When the immediate vicinity of the
nest receives direct sunlight, the eggs are warmed without the aid
of the female, but when there is no sunlight the temperature is
much lower. In order to maintain an appreciably higher nest temperature
the female would have to make frequent trips to spots
perhaps several feet or several yards away to find sunlight. Upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
returning to the nest, her body heat would be quickly dissipated
into the eggs and the surrounding damp soil. She would need to
shuttle back and forth almost continually between the nest and a
spot exposed to sunshine. Cloudy weather often preventing the
warming of the eggs by absorption of solar heat prevails during
much of the incubation season, in the region of the present study,
and probably to an even greater extent throughout the range as a
whole.</p>

<p>Noble and Mason state (<i>op. cit.</i>:9) that while in some non-brooding
kinds of lizards the eggs are actually damaged by turning, the female
<i>fasciatus</i> frequently turns her eggs and moves the whole clutch
about in the nest cavity. On returning to their nests the experimental
females each invariably touched one or more eggs with their tongues
as an olfactory test. Eggs of other kinds of lizards not of the
genus <i>Eumeces</i>, and shellacked eggs of <i>fasciatus</i>, or paraffin models
of them, ordinarily were discarded immediately after a single touch
of the tongue. Eggs of other individuals of the species, and even the
eggs of <i>Eumeces laticeps</i> were accepted as part of the brood.
Any of the experimental females would quickly retrieve one of
her eggs moved a short distance outside the nest cavity. Even if
the whole clutch of eggs were scattered about, the female would,
over a period of hours, gather the eggs and return them to the nest
cavity. This movement of the eggs is accomplished by rolling or
pushing them in a loop of the body or tail, or, less frequently,
by grasping an egg in the jaws, lifting it, and gently placing it in
a new position. Even if the females were blindfolded, they were
still able to retrieve scattered eggs, but one in which the tongue
tip was experimentally removed showed no further interest in its
eggs, presumably having lost the capacity to recognize them by olfactory
test.</p>

<p>In the present study clutches unattended by females were observed
to sustain heavy losses, both in the laboratory and in the
field, and no doubt the attending female performs important
functions other than that of warming the eggs. In the damp or wet
nest cavity, the eggs tend to adhere to each other and to the earth
walls and floor, and become sealed to such surfaces as a result of
partial drying, reducing the amount of surface exposed to the air
and probably hindering respiration. An eggshell sealed in prolonged
contact with the soil tends to rot with the result that it
is easily ruptured, and even if it is not broken there is the likelihood
of fungi or microorganisms gaining entry and killing the embryo.
In many of the eggs that were handled to obtain measurements and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
weight, rupturing of shells occurred. The shells are tough and
elastic to the extent that even when eggs being handled were
accidentally dropped on the floor on several occasions, no damage
to them resulted. However, slight friction on the shell was sometimes
sufficient to puncture one. Particles of sharp rock from the
nest cavity may adhere to the shell, and result in rupturing, perhaps
at weak spots where prolonged contact with the soil has caused
deterioration. The female tends to keep her eggs in a compact
cluster, shifting their position frequently so that no part of an
eggshell adheres to its surroundings long enough for rotting to occur,
and most of the surface of each egg is exposed to the air.</p>

<p>Another important function of the brooding female seems to be
that of altering the nest burrow and shifting the eggs so that the
effects of unfavorable weather are minimized. The usual response to
warm and dry weather is deepening of the nest burrow. A cavity
originally in loose soil on the underside of a flat rock, having the
eggs in contact with the rock surface, may be displaced downward.
The female excavates loose soil from the floor of the burrow and
packs it on the top and sides, until the eggs are two or even three
inches underground, in a cavity different in position and shape
from the original one, although derived from it by gradual stages.
In many instances, however, no such response to drying was observed.
Probably extensive alteration of the nest burrow no longer
is possible after drying of the soil has progressed beyond a certain
stage as these skinks are not strong diggers. In some nests that
were examined frequently, with resulting desertions by the attending
females, the outlines of the cavities became indistinct and the
soil around them became dry and packed. In heavy rains, when
nest burrows are partly flooded, the females move the eggs to avoid
their being submerged. The extent of the female&rsquo;s activity within
the nest burrow is suggested by the glazed condition of the earth
walls and floor, and by the mottled appearance which the eggshells
soon acquire as a result of being slid and dragged about in the nest
cavity.</p>

<p>Still another important function of the female is to dampen the
nest burrow to prevent desiccation of the eggs. Even in dry weather,
females taken from nests almost invariably voided water in relatively
large quantities. They drink dew or other available water,
and may void the contents of the bladder to moisten the nest cavity,
as on numerous occasions, when nests were exposed by raising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
flat rocks covering them, part of the chamber was seen to be recently
watered, and distinctly moister than the surrounding soil.</p>

<p>Noble and Mason (<i>op. cit.</i>:16-19) found that brooding females,
in the laboratory, would vigorously defend their eggs against small
enemies, including mice and lizards and the smaller kinds of snakes
that were tested. The female watched alertly as the intruder approached,
and attempted to bite it if it came too near or touched
an egg. The females failed to defend their nests against persons
and against a large blacksnake; when confronted with such a threat,
the female would run from her nest cavity to hide. Cagle (1940:228)
stated that the brooding females found by him stayed in the
nests even when the logs in which they were situated were chopped
open with an ax, and that the skinks would attempt to bite when
touched with the finger.</p>

<p>In the present study, females whose nests were exposed never
made any active attempt to defend them. Many darted away and
hid as soon as they were exposed. In other instances, especially
when the nest cavity was only partly exposed, from one side, the
female cowered back against the inner wall, opening her mouth in
threat if closely approached. If further molested she might then
attempt to escape. In brooding females a tendency to sluggishness,
and an affinity for the eggs delayed the usually speedy escape reactions.
The temperature of the female was ordinarily lower than
it would have been in the open or on the underside of a flat rock,
and this also tended to slow her reactions. Gravid females when
exposed in nest cavities that still contain no eggs are similarly
sluggish and reluctant to leave differing little or none in behavior
from those that have laid their clutches. Usually the female was
found with her body encircling the eggs, holding them together in
a compact cluster in the center of the nest cavity. The eggs rest
in contact with the loose soil on the floor of the cavity, with each
other, and with the female&rsquo;s body in the case of the outer ones of
the cluster.</p>

<p>Normal brooding habits proved to be difficult to follow because
the females were easily disturbed. In many instances those that
had excavated nest burrows, but had not yet laid, deserted the nests
after the disturbance involved in raising the sheltering rock. Females
that had already laid before discovery of their nests were
somewhat less inclined to desert, but many did so.</p>

<p>On numerous occasions, at the time of year when most females
are gravid and are staying in nest burrows, I have discovered well
formed nest burrows empty and seemingly deserted, with no female
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
in evidence nearby. In some instances the female may have been
out foraging or basking although she was not seen, and in other
instances the female may have been killed by a predator or eliminated
by some other accident. However, it seems that gravid females
frequently do desert their original nest burrows, for one cause
or another, and excavate new ones. Such desertions were noted
many times in the females observed on the study area, where the
disturbance from my own activities in raising the sheltering rocks
may have caused shifts, but it was probably not the sole motivation.
One female shifted approximately 120 feet, to excavate her second
nest burrow in a site that was damper and more heavily shaded
than the first site. This was in the notably dry summer of 1952.
Most of the favorite sites under flat rocks in open situations, that
were used in 1950 and 1951, were not occupied in 1952 or 1953,
although several females did use them for original excavations,
which were deserted before laying, as drought conditions developed.
In the summers of 1952 and 1953 nests were difficult to find, and
those discovered were on the average deeper and better protected
than those found in other years.</p>

<p>As compared with other North American lizards in general,
<i>Eumeces fasciatus</i> is notable for the relatively exposed and superficial
situations chosen as nesting sites. However, it occurs in a
climate of high humidity; in contrast, the great majority of our
lizards live in arid climates where the eggs are in much greater
danger of desiccation, and require better shelter to maintain the
humidity at a sufficiently high level. Accounts in the literature and
observations in the present study indicate that these skinks exercise
a wide range of choice of nesting sites. Ruthven (1911:264) stated
that in northern Michigan nests were usually in decaying logs;
occasional nests were found in burrows in sand, but invariably decaying
wood was present in or around at least part of the nest.</p>

<p>Blanchard (1922) mentions a nest in Tennessee that may have
been made by either this species or <i>E. laticeps</i> &ldquo;in a hollow in a
dead willow tree about fifteen feet from the ground buried in the
loose, damp, rotted wood.&rdquo; Noble and Mason (<i>op. cit.</i>:16) quote
Blanchard (<i>in litt.</i>) that in northern Michigan <i>fasciatus</i> nests in logs
that are exposed to sunlight. Conant (1951:31) stated that several
clutches of eggs found in Ohio were an inch to six inches beneath
the upper surface of the log or stump which sheltered them. Evans
and Roecker (1951:70) record finding two incubating females inside
rotten pine logs, in Ontario. Cagle, studying this species near
Elkville, Illinois, in oak-hickory woods, found 25 natural nests of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
which three were in loose soil among the roots of a fallen tree,
another was under loose bark of a log, and the remainder were all
in cavities of partly decayed logs. Bishop (1926:119) recorded
finding a female with a clutch of eggs beneath damp boards at
Quicksand, Breathitt County, Kentucky.</p>

<p>In the present study, more than one hundred natural nests were
found, of which just one (containing two clutches of eggs) was in
decaying wood beneath the bark of an old log. All other nests
were beneath rocks. On the University of Kansas Natural History
Reservation, where most of the nests were found, the policy is not
to tear apart decaying logs; therefore the nests probably present
in such situations were not ordinarily found. On several occasions
groups of hatchlings were seen on logs within which they probably
had hatched. In the area of the study, however, decaying logs are
scarce. The hardwood forests consist mostly of young trees that
are second growth on cutover areas or pioneer on areas that were
previously grassland. Because of frequent cutting there are few
old mature trees, and logs have not accumulated on the forest floor.
In northeastern Kansas, nesting in logs is comparatively rare. On
wooded slopes and the edges of level hilltops, the flat limestone
rocks that are often abundant provide preferred nesting sites. Even
on collecting trips off the Reservation, where stumps and logs could
be torn apart and searched, flat rocks were found to provide the
main source of nesting sites. These nest rocks varied from less than
an inch in thickness to nine inches or more, and from a few inches
in diameter to three feet or more. Some were resting loosely on the
surface of the soil and others were deeply sunken, on one side. Some
were in situations exposing them to nearly the maximum amount of
sunshine whereas others were in sites nearly always shaded. The
varied character of the nesting sites chosen demonstrated a wide
range of tolerance for temperature, moisture, and other factors, in
the gravid and brooding female and in the developing embryo.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, Noble and Mason (<i>op. cit.</i>:9-10) noted
that females would accept and brood the eggs of other individuals
just as readily as their own, and several writers have reported gregarious
nesting habits, with two or more females occupying either
the same nest cavity, or separate cavities that were in close proximity.
For instance, Cagle wrote that among the small logs he
found to contain nests, four logs each contained one nest, five each
contained two nests, and two each contained three nests, while three
other nests were found within an eight inch square area in loose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
soil among tree roots. McCauley (1939:93) in Maryland found
three females brooding clutches of eggs, which totaled 20, and
which were so near together that there was uncertainty as to which
clutch certain eggs belonged in.</p>

<p>The gregarious nesting habit may be of benefit in permitting
maximum utilization of choice nesting sites, where such sites are
in short supply in an environment otherwise favorable. Also, the
gregarious tendencies make possible more continuous guarding of
the eggs against such natural enemies as can be repulsed by the
female, since each female occasionally interrupts her brooding to
bask or forage.</p>

<p>Many of the nests that I found were in close proximity to others.
Often two nests, and sometimes even three, were found beneath the
same rock, and sometimes a distance of only two or three inches
intervened between the separate clutches. It seemed, however, that
in almost every instance each female had excavated a separate nest
chamber originally. In some instances adjacent nest chambers communicated
with each other.</p>

<p>On July 13, 1948, a communal nest was discovered beneath loose
bark of a decaying elm log. There were 22 eggs in the combined
clutch, and there were two females in the vicinity. The bark was
raised on several different days to examine the eggs, and one or both
females always were found with the eggs.</p>

<p>On June 10, 1949, at the pond rock pile, a flat rock was turned and
an unusual nesting aggregation consisting of a minimum of eight
females, and probably more than ten, was found. The nests were
somewhat disturbed by movement of the rock. The ground beneath
was honeycombed with tunnels connecting the flask-shaped nest
cavities, which were in part open to the rock surface on their upper
sides. Clutches of eggs numbered 13, 12, 11, 8, and 6 (the last
attended by a female which appeared to be still distended with
several more unlaid eggs). Of five other females taken, two had laid
and three were still gravid. Of the five clutches, two had eggs
noticeably larger than those in the other three, and with their shells
mottled brown from adhering earth. These nest cavities were
about half an inch deep and two to three inches wide. The females
were released as soon as they had been examined. One female
moved about over the nest areas exposed, and evinced interest in
a lone egg which had become separated from the others. She moved
up to it, standing high off the ground, with her head turned at
right angles to her body as if preparing to push the egg forward in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the angle thus formed, and tested it with her tongue, but then she
became alarmed and left the vicinity. The flat rock was lowered
over the nests again with a minimum of disturbance.</p>

<p>On July 9, 1949, the flat rock covering the nests was raised again.
Most of the eggs had hatched. Two broods of hatchlings were still
in their respective nest cavities, and one entire clutch had not begun
to hatch although its incubation was nearly completed. Three eggs
of <i>Scincella laterale</i> were found mixed with the <i>Eumeces</i> eggs. One
of these was opened to verify their identity; the other two hatched a
few days later in the laboratory.</p>

<p>The following selected excerpts from my field notes, setting
forth histories of several nests, so far as they were known, give some
idea of the types of nesting sites chosen, the behavior of the females,
and the hazards to which the eggs are exposed.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Hatchlings</h3>

<p>Cagle (1940:229 and 232) has graphically described and illustrated
the hatching of the five-lined skink, and numerous observations
in the present study have served to corroborate his description.
The first indication that the time of hatching is at hand is a twitching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
or jerking movement within the egg which continues until the
shell is slit. According to Noble and Mason (1933:5) the shell is
slit with the elongate premaxillary egg tooth which has its distal
third bent forward nearly at right angles to its base. Some young
remain for an hour or more with only the snout visible, however,
once the head is extruded it is not again withdrawn unless the lizard
is badly startled. The eyes are opened and blinked slowly, closed
for a few minutes, and opened again. After the eyes have become
adjusted, the fore-body emerges and the front legs are freed. In
one clutch, observed by Cagle, hatching time for individual eggs
varied from 45 minutes to five and three-fourths hours. If startled
by visual or tactile stimuli, the little skink may lunge forward
through the slit shell, with a sudden straightening of its body, and
rush away for several inches. Its movements are slow, stiff and
clumsy as compared with those of a skink that is a few days old
and fully active. Hatching of a clutch ordinarily extends over 24
hours or more. Some of the young may be fully hatched and active
before others from the same clutch have slit their eggshells.</p>

<p>Eggs ready to hatch ordinarily weigh somewhat more than one
gram, up to at least as much as 1.7 grams, but much of this weight
is made up of water absorbed during incubation. The hatchlings
usually weigh from .2 to .45 grams. For each of two eggshells
recently vacated, that were washed and squeezed dry, weights were
approximately .125 grams. Hatchlings of the same brood differ
perceptibly in size with several per cent variation in total length,
and weight. Some seem to be less fully developed than others. On
July 8, 1952, hatching of the last young in a clutch was observed.
Upon emergence, it differed in appearance from the others of the
brood hatched a few hours earlier. The top of its head bulged
slightly as in fetuses. The umbilicus was not yet closed, and the
protruding yolk mass hindered the hatchling&rsquo;s movements and made
crawling difficult. In order to progress it had to stand high off the
ground to prevent its ventral surface from dragging. Protrusion of
the yolk mass has been described in newly emerged hatchlings for
the closely related <i>E. anthracinus</i> (Clausen, 1938:3-7) as well as in
<i>fasciatus</i>. Cagle (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states that the mass of yolk is at first
about 3 mm. in diameter, but is completely used at the end of the
third day. A group of young retained by him, without food, died
the sixth day after hatching, seemingly from starvation. Three of
five recently hatched young were found by Cagle to have eaten ant
pupae placed in a box with them on the preceding day, even though
the skinks still retained the yolk masses. One hatchling of this group
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
ate its own tail that had been broken off in handling. Cagle described
a color change taking place during the first few hours after
hatching; the ground color, dull greenish at first, darkens to an
iridescent black, the pale stripes are altered from an original tan
color to bronze, with a tinge of reddish on the head, and the ventral
surface which is partially transparent showing the outlines of the
internal organs at first, soon becomes opaque white.</p>

<p>Contrary to the statement by Noble and Mason (1933:5) that
in captivity the hatchlings seldom stayed together more than a few
hours, litters of young fully active, a day or two after hatching were
found in the nests with the females still looped around them on
several occasions. On one such occasion, although the brood scattered
immediately into surrounding vegetation where they hid, I
succeeded in catching the female and six of the young, and put
them all together in a nylon bag to carry them back to the laboratory.
Several hours after the bag had been placed on a table it
was noticed that the family had again gathered into a compact
cluster in the bag with the female&rsquo;s body looped around the young
in the characteristic brooding position seen in those with young or
eggs in their nest cavities. When hatching is complete, the female
may leave before the young have dispersed. On August 5, 1950, a
nest under observation was found to have all of the young or most
of them still clustered in the cavity, but the female was not in evidence.
The young were active, and immediately took alarm as the
rock was raised exposing them. Almost instantly, they scattered
and vanished. Subsequent search revealed five of the young, each
poorly concealed in tufts of grass or under dry leaves or other
ground litter at the edges of the depression where the rock had lain.
Once hidden, these young were reluctant to run again and depended
on concealment.</p>

<p>Having once left the nest, the young probably do not return to
it, as many nests examined within a few days after hatching were
never found occupied either by females or young after their original
dispersal. As soon as the dispersal occurs family ties are permanently
severed. On July 19, 1950, a group of active hatchlings was
observed moving about over a log, on what was probably the first
day of activity away from the nest. The log was in the bottom of a
steep-walled gully, where it had come to rest the night before. It
had been an erect but dead and partly undermined snag on the
edge of the gully, and was blown down that night in a violent
thunderstorm. Most of the log was held clear of the rushing water
in the bottom of the gully by projecting limbs. The little skinks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
were darting in and out of holes and crevices in the log, pausing frequently
to bask. As many as four were in sight simultaneously,
but probably the total included several more, as it was difficult to
keep track of individuals. An adult female, presumably the mother
of the litter was also present, but she took no interest in the young,
and they showed no evidence of dependence on her. On the contrary,
several times when one or another of the young happened
to come near the female in the course of its wandering, and noticed
her, it was seen to shy away in sudden alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

size ranges at different times of year, and differences in trend between
the two years are brought out.</p>
</div>

<p>The young were much more active than the female. These and
other young observed in the open were almost constantly in motion.
Pauses to bask at any one spot were of only a few seconds duration.
A certain log in Skink Woods evidently was the site of one or more
successful skink nests each year that observations were made, although
a nest was actually found in it only in 1948. On July 26,
1950, recently hatched young were active on this log. Temperature
was about 22&#176;C. and the young were alternating frequently between
shade and sunshine to maintain their body temperature.
Collectively they seemed to cover every square inch of the log surface,
poking and probing into niches, crevices and insect borings.
They had a tendency to seek out the highest points on the log as
resting places.</p>

<p>In moving about, foraging or sunning, the young often carry the
tail arched high, and keep it in motion with slow squirming undulations.
These undulations may be continued even when the lizard
itself has come to rest momentarily. The movements of the tail
together with its vivid blue color serve to attract attention to it.
Such behavior has not been observed in adults or partly grown
young. Jopson (1938:90) observed an instance in which two dogs
cornered a young five-lined skink (either the present species or
<i>E. laticeps</i>) but were distracted by the wriggling of its bright blue
tail &ldquo;either dropped by autotomy or knocked off&rdquo; so that the skink
itself was allowed to escape. On another occasion these same two
dogs attacking an adult male skink, were not distracted by the
wriggling but dull colored broken tail, and they killed the lizard.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Growth</h3>

<p>The subject of growth in <i>Eumeces</i> was briefly discussed by Taylor
(1936:66) in his revision of the genus. Sorting fairly large series
of museum specimens into seeming age-size groups, Taylor concluded
that skinks require as much as 9 or 10 years to attain adult
size. For <i>fasciatus</i>, for instance, the snout-vent length of 65.7 mm.
(small adult size) was considered typical of individuals in their
ninth year of life, with yearly gain of only 6 or 7 mm. in length in
the young. I have seen the original data on which this conclusion
was based, and the age groupings, as assigned by Taylor, seemed
plausible. However, in the light of present knowledge, it is certain
that the seeming intervals between his assumed age groups would
have disappeared with a still larger series of specimens. The eight
or nine size groups that Taylor recognized as distinct annual age
groups actually comprise only two age groups, each having such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
wide dispersion of individuals (by retardation of some and acceleration
of others) that there is overlapping in size between them.</p>

<p>Growth in reptiles is now much better understood. Many species
have been studied by a variety of methods, including observation of
growth in captives, recording of growth in marked individuals
living under natural conditions, and sorting of large series into
age-size groups. Two species of <i>Eumeces</i> have been studied in
some detail. Breckenridge (1943:601-602) marked all the individuals
of <i>septentrionalis</i> that could be found in a small colony in
Minnesota and he concluded from the growth recorded in several
that were recaptured, that these skinks grow to mature size (65 mm.
and larger) at the end of their second year of life and are ready to
breed the following spring. Rodgers and Memmler (1943:61) plotted
the size distribution of a large year-round collection of <i>skiltonianus</i>
from near Berkeley, California. They found that in this species
hatching occurs in July and August, hatchlings are about 25 mm.
in snout-vent length, and grow to about 50 mm. by the time they are
one year old, and to about 65 mm. at two years of age, but most of
them breed at the end of their third year. Within the genus the
species <i>septentrionalis</i> and <i>skiltonianus</i> belong to groups separate
from each other and from that including <i>fasciatus</i>. While <i>septentrionalis</i>
and <i>skiltonianus</i> resemble each other in their growth pattern
and in the time required to reach sexual maturity, <i>fasciatus</i>
is notably different in its more rapid growth and the shorter time it
requires to reach breeding maturity. This would scarcely be expected,
as all three are of similar size. Furthermore, <i>skiltonianus</i> in
the region of Rodgers&rsquo; and Memmler&rsquo;s study has a longer growing
season than <i>fasciatus</i> in northeastern Kansas, while <i>septentrionalis</i>
in Minnesota has a growing season markedly shorter than either.
It is noteworthy that each of these three skinks is the northernmost
lizard in the section of the country where it occurs.</p>

<p>In the present study growth was investigated by measuring
and marking large numbers of young, many of which were recaptured
for subsequent records, and by sorting into age-size groups all
available measurements. An understanding of the latter set of
data was facilitated by correlating it with the growth records of
marked individuals. Changes in the phenology of growth from
year to year according to weather conditions were noted.</p>

<p>As already indicated, hatching occurs from early July to mid-August
in northeastern Kansas. Unseasonably cool weather with
frequent rains may cause cumulative delay in breeding and incubation
so that hatching may average several weeks later than it does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
in years with relatively warm and dry weather during the breeding
season. Within any one year hatching time is concentrated, so that
the majority of the young hatch within a period of two weeks, but
microclimates in the situations where the nests are made may differ
enough to cause this much spread. Individuals living on north
slopes in thick woods, and receiving the minimum amount of sunlight
may have their emergence from hibernation and attainment
of breeding condition delayed. Later, nesting in the same situations,
they may have incubation of their clutches similarly delayed.</p>

<p>Newly hatched young average just under an inch in snout-vent
length (23-27 mm.) and weigh .2 to .45 grams. Most rapid growth
occurs in the period of weeks following hatching. The growth rate
during this late summer period cannot be well shown by comparing
average size of series taken on successive dates, because each series
is likely to include some newly hatched young.</p>

<p>In 1949, a series of recently hatched young averaged 26.7 mm. on
July 10. By August 26, average length in a series collected was
42.9 mm., indicating an average gain of at least .35 mm. per day.
One that may be considered typical was marked on July 23, 1950,
soon after hatching, and it had a snout-vent length of 26.5 mm. and
weighed .25 grams. It was recaptured just a month later when it
had grown to 36 mm. snout-vent length, and weighed .8 grams.
Potential growth rate under favorable conditions is shown by the
fact that some individuals have attained a snout-vent length of 50
mm. by the third week of August, thus approximately doubling their
hatching length. A maximum growth rate of about .5 mm. per day
is indicated for these accelerated individuals, but on the average,
young are considerably less than 50 mm. in length even when they
enter hibernation. At the other extreme, representing retarded
growth, is an individual having a snout-vent length of only 34 mm.
on May 1. It must have been approximately nine months old on
that date, but of course had spent at least six months in hibernation.
Even if it made rapid growth subsequently, this yearling could
scarcely have attained by midsummer the pre-hibernation length of
the most accelerated individuals.</p>

<p>During the growing season following their first hibernation period,
the young grow to small adult size in most instances. After emerging
from a second hibernation they mature sexually and constitute an
important part of the breeding population.</p>

<p>Many of the skinks marked before their first hibernation, as
hatchlings, when they were a few days or a few weeks old, were
subsequently recaptured as well-grown yearlings or small adults,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
affording ample information as to the usual growth rate and the
extremes of acceleration or retardation that occasionally occur. Records
of selected individuals in this group of skinks, marked early
in life and recaptured after a hibernation, are recorded below.</p>

<p>Adult skinks can be found in greatest numbers in the breeding
season and many of the young that were marked were recaptured
as newly matured breeding adults soon after their second hibernation,
often still short of average adult size. Selected records of such

<p>A certain small percentage fail to attain minimum adult size or
breeding maturity by the time of emergence from their second
hibernation. Among 77 individuals marked as young either soon
after hatching or in spring and early summer, and recaptured the
following spring, only one had failed to grow to adult size. It was
46.5 mm. in length when marked on June 13. When recaptured on
April 25 of the following year, it had grown to a length of 59 mm.,
still short of minimum adult length. During the interval between
captures it had maintained about the average growth rate. Its
failure to attain maturity was obviously the result of its early retardation,
and probably late hatching was primarily responsible. Although
this is the only individual with known history, which failed
to attain breeding maturity after its second hibernation, occasional
specimens are taken in spring which are somewhat below adult size
but seem too large to be young hatched the preceding summer.
Obviously, the incidence of such failure from year to year would
be influenced by weather conditions, and an unusually cool summer
may result in such delayed laying and hatching that an unusually
large proportion of young might fail to attain sexual maturity at the
usual time. At more northern localities, the percentage of such
failures might be expected to increase. At the northern edge of the
range attainment of breeding maturity may normally require more
than two years. Such delayed development would result in a
drastic reduction of the reproductive potential which might be
critically limiting to the species, even in an otherwise favorable
environment, as the population would be unable to replace rapidly
enough the individuals eliminated by normal mortality factors.</p>

<p>In contrast to the delayed development of those that have failed
to attain maturity at an age of two years, is the accelerated development
of those that have already more than doubled in length before
the first hibernation, and continue to grow rapidly after emergence.
By late spring they are already approaching adult size, perhaps
even before laying has occurred, and while breeding is still in progress.
It is certain that in northeastern Kansas there is no breeding
by such accelerated individuals approaching adult size at an age
of nine or ten months. Farther south in the species&rsquo; range with a
much longer growing season, there is perhaps some possibility of
such early breeding by first-year individuals. This would reduce
by more than half the length of time required for a generation, and
would tremendously increase the reproductive potential. With
such added impetus to its reproduction the species might be able
to withstand greatly increased predation pressure, or other mortality
factors.</p>

<p>Extremes of acceleration or retardation are relatively rare in the
population studied. Nevertheless, in April there are some individuals
between 50 and 60 mm. in snout-vent length which cannot
be classified with certainty as to their age group, and might be either
accelerated individuals about nine months old or retarded individuals
about 21 months old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The spread in size for any given age group is especially large, if
data from different years are combined. A typical individual,
having a snout-vent length of 25 mm. at hatching in mid-July may
have attained 30 mm. by early August, 35 mm. by late August, and
45 mm. by the time it hibernates late in September. Emerging
shortly before the middle of April it may grow to 50 mm. by the end
of May, 58 mm. by the end of June, and more than 60 mm. by the
end of July when it is a little more than a year old. By the time
of its second hibernation it may have attained a length of from
65 mm. to 70 mm., and emerges from this hibernation as a breeding
adult.</p>

</div>

<p>In reptiles in general there is a wide range in adult size, and the
extent and rapidity of continued growth after attainment of sexual
maturity and minimum adult size is still insufficiently understood.
Information bearing on this problem was obtained in the present
study from the recapture of marked skinks already measured as
adults. It is evident that the growth rate of the young, amounts to
as much as 15 mm. per month in snout-vent length in the late summer
period from hatching until hibernation, averages perhaps three
or four mm. per month in the summer after emergence from the first
hibernation, and tapers off rapidly as adult size is approached.</p>

<p>One hundred of the skinks marked as adults or subadults and recaptured
after intervals of months, including, in most instances, one
or more hibernation periods, represent in the aggregate, 87 years of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
growth. These records show that after minimum adult size of 65
mm. is attained, growth slows abruptly, and that by the time a length
of approximately 75 mm. is attained in most instances growth has
become extremely slow in males and has virtually stopped in females.
Males attain a maximum size several millimeters larger than
that of females. Individuals differ greatly in their growth, however;
some adults continue to grow rapidly till they near the maximum
size, whereas others apparently stop growing when they are
still below average adult size. Unusually large specimens are not
necessarily old, but may have attained their size only a year or two
after reaching maturity through the accelerated growth resulting
from abundant food and predisposing genetic factors. Likewise,
unusually old individuals are not necessarily the largest, but may be
only a little above average adult size. It may be assumed that no
growth occurs during the period of winter dormancy, which occupies
approximately half the year in the population studied. To
compute growth rates, in those recaptured after an intervening
hibernation, periods of hibernation, arbitrarily estimated as six
months, were subtracted from the time elapsed between captures.</p>

<p>Opportunity to compare the rapid growth of young during their
first year of life with the relatively slow continued growth after attainment
of sexual maturity is afforded by the records of skinks
caught and marked while yet immature and recaptured in two or
more successive years after their attainment of sexual maturity.
The records of selected individuals of this group are presented below.
With the exception of number three, all in this series are of
the 1949 brood, and probably all hatched within a two-week period.</p>

<p>Differences in their growth rates therefore reflect differences in sex,
individual vigor, and local situation, in individuals living at the same
time and within the same general environment.</p>

<p>Changing weather, and other factors that vary from year to year
cause marked differences in the dates of important events in the
annual cycle, and in the stage of development at any given date.
Data are available for five successive annual broods of young, those
of 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951, and 1952, and each brood differs from the
others to some extent, as shown in Figures <a href="#fig11">11</a> to <a href="#fig13">13</a>. In 1949, for
instance, young hatched relatively early, and probably most of them
were active by the middle of July. They made rapid growth in
August, averaging larger than young hatched in other years on any
given date in late summer. However, they retired into dormancy
early in the fall. Cool and dry weather in early September ended
their activity for the season. In 1950, young hatched, on the average,
at least three weeks later, about the first of August, but they
remained active until late in September, and by hibernation time
had partly caught up to the stage of development attained by the
young of 1949. Most young of 1951 hatched late in the first half of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
August, and at first were smaller than those of 1950 and much
smaller than those of 1949 on corresponding dates, but favorable
weather in the early fall hastened their development. By early September
they had caught up and passed the stage of development of
young of 1950 and by the time they retired to dormancy in late September,
they had reduced by half the size-advantage of the young of
1949 at the time these latter retired into hibernation. The young of
1951 appeared to be few in numbers, and a lack of competition may
have been a factor in their rapid early development.</p>

less rapidly than those of <a href="#fig14">Fig. 14</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The young of 1948, first sampled after their emergence from their
first hibernation in mid-April of 1949, were then somewhat intermediate
in size as compared with those of 1949 and 1950 at the same
times of year. Their subsequent development was rapid; by late
May they had caught up and passed the stage reached by the 1949
young at the same time of year. The young of 1950 after having a
late start, were further set back by cold weather in April 1951 delaying
their emergence from hibernation. As a result they were still
unusually small in late April and May. Even though they grew
rapidly subsequently, they were consistently smaller than those of
other broods on corresponding dates. Favorable fall weather prolonging
the 1951 growing season into late September beyond the
time of retirement in other years may have permitted many of them
to attain adult size.</p>

</div>

<p>The varying fortunes of the several annual broods studied were
closely correlated with weather trends, and suggest possible effects
of slight changes in climate. An unfavorable sequence of weather
might bring about drastic reduction of the population without causing
any direct mortality. A late spring in two successive years
would have cumulative effect in delaying emergence and breeding
of adults the first year, and delaying in the second year emergence
of the young, already retarded by the lateness of their hatching. If
this sequence were followed by onset of unusually cool and dry
weather in early September, or even in late August, the young might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
be &ldquo;caught short,&rdquo; and forced to hibernate while still in the 50-60
mm. size class. Emerging the following spring, they might have
failed to mature sexually, reducing by perhaps half the number of
productive adults. At the northern extreme of the species&rsquo; range,
length of growing season may be more critical than extremes of temperature
in limiting the numbers and distribution. Growing seasons
that average long enough and warm enough to permit attainment of
maturity by onset of the second hibernation period may be essential
to the species. While no two annual broods of young in the same
locality come under exactly the same weather influences, extremes
of retardation or acceleration continuing throughout development
are relatively rare. Retarding effects of unfavorable weather causing
delayed breeding and hatching, may be offset by prolongation
of warm weather in the fall thus delaying hibernation, or by warm
spring weather hastening emergence from hibernation.</p>

<p>Under favorable conditions an adult female produces about ten
offspring annually of which about half are females. It is calculated
that if all survived, after ten breeding seasons, the progeny of an
original female might have increased to a population of more than
97,000, under the climatic conditions of eastern Kansas, permitting
attainment of breeding maturity late in the second year of life. In
the same ten year period under climatic conditions delaying maturity
until late in the third year of life (as seems normally to occur in
<i>E. septentrionalis</i> and <i>E. skiltonianus</i>, and probably in <i>E. fasciatus</i>
at the northern edge of its range) the original female would have
produced a population of somewhat less than 7,800 assuming that
all survived. With a long growing season such as occurs in the
southern part of the range, it seems theoretically possible (though
not probable) that individuals might mature before the end of their
first year, in time to participate in the next breeding season. If this
should occur the original female might produce a population of
more than 120 million by the end of the tenth breeding season.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Changes in Pattern</h3>

<p>Progressive alteration of the color pattern is more rapid in males
than in females and is synchronized with growth. During the first
year of life changes in the pattern are gradual, and consist chiefly of
loss in vividness. The blue of the tail is slightly dulled. The light
lines become suffused with brown and the dorsolateral dark areas
become paler, with light brown areas appearing on the corners of
the scales and gradually spreading to replace the original black. In
skinks that are in the second year of life the striped pattern although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
still conspicuous is made up of two shades of brown instead of the
earlier black and white markings.</p>

<p class="fig_caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span> Records of another group of immature skinks marked and recaptured
within the same growing season.</p>
</div>

<p>Even in hatchlings, the dorsal part of the rostrum and the inter-nasals
are of a somewhat neutral brownish color, matching neither
the light lines nor the dark interspaces of the striped body pattern.
With advancing age this neutral brown color gradually spreads posteriorly
on the head so that the striking lyrate marking of the bifurcated
dorsal stripe on the head in the juvenile become obscured
by the time the skink has grown to small adult size, at 21 months.
The top of the head is then dull brown, with a slightly mottled
appearance caused by the different intensity of pigmentation in
different areas. The stripes though still discernible, are faint and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
inconspicuous. Dorsally, on the body, the stripes are still conspicuous,
but are dull and lacking in contrast. At this stage, the
dark lateral area is retained with intensity of pigmentation scarcely
diminished.</p>

<p>In tracing the gradual ontogenetic changes in the striped pattern,
from the vividly contrasting colors of hatchlings to the dull, patternless
coloration of old adult males, five descriptive terms have been
applied to the successive stages: &ldquo;sharp,&rdquo; &ldquo;distinct,&rdquo; &ldquo;dull,&rdquo; &ldquo;faint,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;absent.&rdquo; To most individuals below minimum adult size, the
term &ldquo;sharp&rdquo; is applicable, although there is some loss in vividness
in the larger young, as compared with hatchlings. Fading of the
original striped pattern proceeds more rapidly on the head than on
the body. Upon emergence from their second hibernation at an
age of about 21 months, the skinks, mostly grown to adult size, and
ready to mature sexually, still show but little sexual difference. They
retain the hatchling pattern essentially unchanged, but with colors
dulled and contrasts reduced. Within a few weeks the newly matured
males undergo relatively rapid color change as the breeding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
season progresses. The stripes tend to fade and blend into the dark
areas adjacent to them. In the two-year-old males stripes are distinct
to dull on the body and faint or absent on the head, while in
females of the same age group, body stripes are sharp or distinct.</p>

<p><a href="#Table_13">Table 13</a> refers to adult pattern and coloration as they appear in
the breeding season. After the breeding season, in late spring and
early summer, when the red suffusion of the head and neck has
faded in adult males, the original striped pattern, after having been
almost completely suppressed may again become discernible. Individuals
of the same size differ in extent of pattern change, and
the color descriptions made of individuals were not sufficiently detailed
to show fully the changes occurring between successive dates
of capture. However, most large adult males taken later than mid-June
had at least some trace of the striped body pattern and many
of them had become so much like females in appearance that close
scrutiny was necessary to determine their sex. They were especially
like females in having the dark lateral area extending forward onto
the cheek and setting it off sharply from the paler temporal region
above it. In breeding males the head has no such dark markings
and is suffused with red.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Growth and Regeneration of the Tail</h3>

<p>Even among those skinks which have never broken their tails
there is a wide range of variation in relative length of tail. This is
partly a matter of relative growth since the proportions change
during the course of development. Also there may be slight sexual
difference and there is much individual variation. In fetuses still
well below hatching size, the tail length is less than the snout-vent
length. For instance, an egg in a natural nest 12 days short of
hatching contained a fetus that had a snout-vent length of 14 mm.
and tail length of 12 mm. (<a href="#fig18">Figure 18</a>). In the late stages of fetal
development the tail growth is relatively rapid. At hatching, the
tail is considerably more than half the total length. In a large
series of young with snout-vent lengths from 30 mm. down to hatching
size of 25 mm. or less, the tail length averaged 130.8 per cent of
snout-vent length. In larger young, up to a snout-vent length of 40
mm. or more, the tail continues to lengthen more rapidly than the
body. In skinks that are about two thirds grown, the tails average
relatively longer than in either larger or smaller individuals. In
the sample representing the size class 50-54 mm. snout-vent length,
the tails average 163.3 per cent of the snout-vent lengths, whereas
in groups of adults of various sizes and both sexes, the tail length
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
is near 155 or 156 per cent of the snout-vent length. Sexual dimorphism
in tail length is slight if it exists at all; in adult males,
tails averaged a little longer than in adult females.</p>

length) in skinks of different size groups that retain their original tails unbroken;
in the early stages of growth the tail becomes relatively longer as size
increases, but the trend is reversed before adult size is attained. For each
series the mean, standard error, standard deviation, and extremes are shown.</p>
</div>

<p>When a skink&rsquo;s tail is broken, there is almost no loss of blood.
The fractured surface is rough and irregular, with exposed muscle
masses protruding on the detached end and corresponding concavities
on the end of the stump tail retained by the lizard. The concavities
are soon filled with oozing blood, and a thick scab forms. As
healing begins, the broken end presents a flat, slightly irregular surface.
When the scab is sloughed off, a slightly convex surface of
delicate, pale-colored new skin of the regenerating tail, is exposed.
At first, no scale structure is discernible. As growth proceeds, the
new tail takes on a bluntly conical shape. During the early stages
of growth, it is well set off from the original portion by the abrupt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
taper at the point of contact and by its paler coloration and different
texture, with no scales discernible at first, and later with fine
and granular scalation. The new tail elongates until the more
abrupt taper beyond the point of the break is no longer noticeable,
and the coloration, surface texture and scalation match that of the
original portion so closely that it is difficult to determine where the
break occurred or even to ascertain that there has been one. On
the regenerated tail, however, the scales are less uniform in size and
less regular in shape. The regenerated tail, being different from
the original in internal structure, with a cartilaginous rod replacing
the vertebral column, is less fragile and subsequent fractures are
most likely to be on the part proximal to the regeneration. Nevertheless,
fractures of regenerated tails occur occasionally. In old
skinks especially, the tail eventually may consist of three or more distinct
segments including the basal remnant of the original tail and
the successive regenerations. When a break in the regenerated tail
occurs, the detached portion is relatively inert, and is capable of only
feeble twitching movements in contrast with the lively wriggling
normally displayed in a newly detached tail that includes part of
the central nervous system.</p>

skinks which have had their tails broken and regenerated; for each individual,
length of each part of the tail is expressed as a percentage of the snout-vent
length.</p>
</div>

<p>Rate of growth in the regenerating tail is controlled by a variety
of factors, such as age, condition, and activity of the individual, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
site of the fracture. A break occurring early in the skink&rsquo;s lifetime
results in regeneration more complete than occurs in an adult sustaining
the same type of injury. The regenerated tail eventually
may be longer and thicker than the lost part if the lizard is young
and still growing. But the regenerated tail is never so long as the
original one would have been. Regeneration is most extensive in
those tails broken near the base. The farther from the base the
break occurs the shorter is the part regenerated. As a result, tails
that have had time to regenerate do not differ greatly in total length
regardless of where the break occurred. However, the nearer the
break is to the base, the shorter is the total tail-length after regeneration
(Figures <a href="#fig19">19</a> and <a href="#fig20">20</a>). If only the tip of the tail is lost, regeneration
may not occur. In the skinks examined that had regenerated
tails the proportions varied over a wide range. Presumably,
in many, growth of the regenerated portion was still incomplete.</p>

<p>Under favorable conditions regeneration occurs at a relatively
rapid rate. After a period of healing the new tail grows with a
sudden spurt, making most of its gain in length within a few weeks.
Then growth abruptly slows or ceases altogether. In young similarly
rapid growth of the regenerating tail occurs, but subsequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the increase is more gradual corresponding to the over-all growth
of the lizard. In numerous adult skinks marked, and recorded as
having well-regenerated tails, the proportions recorded at subsequent
captures months or years later were still just the same, demonstrating
that extent of regeneration is not proportional to elapsed
time. Those adult skinks having unusually long regenerated tails
presumably are individuals in which the original tail was lost early
in life, and the potentiality for regeneration is probably somewhat
less in older individuals, especially those that have stopped growing.</p>

<p>Successive records of selected individuals are listed in <a href="#Table_14">Table 14</a>
to illustrate trends in regeneration of the tail. In those instances in
which the tail is referred to as &ldquo;newly broken&rdquo; the separation usually
occurred as an accident at the time the lizard was captured, while
in those designated as &ldquo;recently broken&rdquo; separation had already
occurred in some earlier accident but regeneration was not yet
perceptibly underway. In the &ldquo;Tail length&rdquo; column, plus signs
separate the original portion of tail, on the left, from the regenerated
portion, on the right.</p>

<p>As in many other kinds of lizards, the tail in the five-lined skink
serves as a reservoir for fat, which may be drawn upon for nutrition
in time of food scarcity. An individual that is in good condition
has a plump and rounded tail. Fat comprises much of its
bulk. Upon emergence from hibernation this fat supply is not
noticeably depleted. Brooding females in the latter part of the
incubation period have the supply of caudal fat most noticeably
depleted, and their tails may appear emaciated, with kinks on the
terminal portion. It is my impression that in adults the capacity
for storage of fat is most developed in the females, and that their
tails vary in proportions more than do those of males. The capacity
to shed the tail easily seems somewhat inconsistent with this function
of fat storage. Loss of the tail sometimes involves loss of a
large amount of reserve fat. Many detached tails that were broken
accidentally at the time of the skinks&rsquo; captures were weighed. In
those that were broken off near the base and were not previously
regenerated, weights were usually 16 to 20 percent of the lizards&rsquo;
total weights.</p>


<h2>Movements</h2>

<p>Data obtained concerning the movements of these skinks demonstrated
that individuals tend to limit their activities to small areas
thoroughly familiar to them, and wander but little. Although the
nature and extent of movements in reptiles in general, and in lizards
especially, are poorly known, my findings are perhaps what might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
be expected from the studies of earlier workers on various other
species of reptiles.</p>

<p>Goin and Goin (1951:29) observed that <i>Eumeces laticeps</i> in
Florida lives in hollow stumps, each individual excluding other
adults from its stump but tolerating young. Movements have not
been studied in detail in any member of the Scincidae, however.
The observations of Goin and Goin, and those of other authors,
seem to indicate that <i>E. laticeps</i> is territorial, and that each individual
centers its activities about a tree or snag, regularly using the
same hollow as a shelter and home base. In contrast, <i>E. fasciatus</i>
is not territorial and has no regular home base.</p>

<p>The iguanid genus <i>Sceloporus</i> is perhaps better known than any
other kind of lizard as regards its movements. Studies by Newman
and Patterson (1909), Stebbins and Robinson (1946), and Fitch
(1940) on three different species have shown that individuals of
<i>Sceloporus</i> keep to small individual areas, and that territoriality is
well developed, in some species at least.</p>

<p>Among other reptiles, turtles are much better known, as detailed
studies of movements have been made on several species, of which
the life histories and ecology have been thoroughly investigated
(Nichols, 1939; Cagle, 1942 and 1944; Woodbury and Hardy, 1948;
Stickel, 1950). They have been found to have well-defined and
fairly extensive home ranges, which are not defended as territories.
Studies of movements in several different kinds of snakes, by
Blanchard and Finster (1933), Stickel and Cope (1947), Fitch
(1949), Lowe and Norris (1950), and Carpenter (1952) have
shown that these reptiles usually have definite home ranges, which
may be several or many acres in extent. Their home ranges are
not defended as territories against other members of the species.
In general, turtles and snakes have been found to occupy home
ranges that are much larger than those of lizards.</p>

<p>Most information concerning movements of <i>Eumeces fasciatus</i>
has been obtained from the recapture of marked individuals. Actual
distances of travel, and the time, frequency and motivation of movement
was uncertain. A skink marked, recorded, and subsequently
recaptured at a second location may have wandered widely in the
meantime, visiting points relatively remote from either location of
capture. The two points of capture may be within a home range
regularly or occasionally covered by the individual in the course
of its routine activities; or the second point may have been recorded
only after a permanent shift of activities away from the area within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
which the original point was located. Various types of movements
probably were involved.</p>

<p>Interpretation of the records is difficult because of the paucity of
direct observations on the behavior and movements of skinks under
natural conditions. Often when one is alarmed, it will run as much
as 30 feet, in a fairly direct course, to a tree or bush or rock where
it can find refuge. Undisturbed individuals move about slowly and
circuitously. It is difficult to keep one under observation for any
length of time because of the secretive habits causing it to keep
under cover, as much as possible while moving about, and to hide
in response to any slight disturbance.</p>

<p>It is obvious that individuals shift their activities from time to
time, occupying new areas either abruptly or by gradual stages.
Even though a successful skink has a life span of several or many
years, the populations on the small study areas were found to be
much altered from one year to the next. Presumably this change
was brought about largely by shifts in home ranges. Several shifts
of hundreds of feet were recorded, but the chances of recovering
marked individuals that moved so far were relatively poor because
their movements generally took them beyond the limits of the study
area to locations where recapture was unlikely. Skinks often were
caught at their hiding places beneath rocks or other sheltering
objects. In many of these instances it was evident from the position,
temperature and state of activity of the lizard that it had been
in the open but had become alarmed as the collector drew near and
had retreated unnoticed to its shelter just before capture, whereas
in other instances it was obviously at rest in its chosen shelter. Except
for females in their nest burrows individuals were not ordinarily
recaptured regularly at the same hiding places. They may seek
new hiding places after each period of activity.</p>

<p>However many of the skinks captured were taken again, after
long intervals, near the same places. Time elapsed between successive
captures for different individuals ranged from one day to
47 months. Of the total of 323 recaptured by September, 1952,
approximately half, 162, were taken after intervals including one or
more hibernation periods. In appraising home ranges and detecting
the occasional shifts over a relatively long time span, chronology
of the records needs to be taken into account. Records clustering
about the same center seem to indicate continued occupancy of an
established home range. However, when one or more early records
are well separated from one or more later records, a shift in range
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
seems probable. In some instances successive records were progressively
farther from the starting point suggesting two or more
shifts in the same direction from an original home range.</p>

<p>Although recorded movements varied from a few inches to hundreds
of yards, the most noteworthy feature in general was the short
distance between points of capture (considered in relation to the
potential mobility of the lizards) after days, weeks, months or years.
In many instances no movement was demonstrable, even though
successive points of capture were not exactly the same. Named
natural landmarks, mostly trees, boulders and logs, well distributed
over the study area, were used as a basis for locating points on the
map. Direction and distance in feet to the nearest landmark was
recorded for each site of capture, but for distances of more than
25 feet estimates were made to the nearest ten feet. Usually at
least one landmark was available within a 50-foot radius from any
point where a capture was made. Occasional estimates made for
distances of more than 50 feet, or even more than 100 feet, in the
absence of suitable landmarks nearby, were sources of inaccuracy.
For such estimates errors of up to ten feet were common, and some
errors of greater magnitude were made.</p>

<p>For most individuals successive sites of capture tended to cluster
within a small area, but the occasional outlying capture sites indicate
that each individual does range outside the area in which its
activities are concentrated. These occasional excursions cannot be
consistently attributed to any one ecologic requirement, nor are
they limited to any particular time within the season of activity.
Adult males, however, tend to make longer movements in the brief
period of concentrated sexual activity, thereby increasing their
chances of finding mates. Similarly, adult females may wander
beyond their usual ranges in search of suitable nesting sites. The
home range may be thought of as consisting of a small central portion
where activities are largely concentrated, and an outer area
several times as large, familiar to the animal but used to a lesser
extent by it. The activities gradually become more diffuse farther
from the central part of the home range. In the five-lined skink,
home ranges are unlikely to approximate the circular shape because
they are molded with respect to environmental features that are not
uniformly distributed. A rotting log, an old tree with decayed
hollow base and nearby fallen slabs of bark and dead limbs, a rock
outcrop with numerous deep holes and crevices, or a group of flat
rocks in a forest glade fulfill requirements not met in the surrounding
habitat with the result that home ranges are built around them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Consequently a home range may be long and narrow, with maximum
diameter several times the minimum diameter.</p>

<p>The usual concept of home range, as a finite area with well defined
boundaries is not entirely satisfactory for an animal with the
habits of the five-lined skink. The skink spends much of its time
in inactivity underground or otherwise concealed and sheltered,
and when it does move about it takes advantage of natural travel-ways
over rock surfaces, tree trunks, and logs. If a log happens to
be the home range center, the skink may travel the length of the
log many times without making a comparable trip at right angles to
this axis of travel, although it may make short side dashes to secure
food. On more extended forays, the directional sequence of movements
is largely controlled by the distribution of suitable cover and
travel routes, as the skink avoids both open areas and dense vegetation.
Outlying portions of the home range probably are not
uniformly covered but are reached only occasionally as the lizard
is led along some natural travel route, or after it has visited, in succession,
a series of locations attractive in providing shelter or food.</p>

<p>Marked skinks were recaptured at distances up to 680 feet from
points of original capture. Considering only the most remote points
of capture for those individuals recaptured more than once, the
average recorded movement for the entire group of 323 recaptured
skinks was 58 feet. This figure provides a basis for comparing vagility
of this species with others. Eliminating some individuals of indefinite
status, the average movement for 75 adult males was 69
feet; for 102 adult females, 45 feet; and for 112 young, 61 feet.
For the adult females, home range data are biased by the fact that
many were caught repeatedly at or near their nests. It is not clear
whether females that do not have nests range less widely than males.</p>

<p>Only 15 individuals, less than five per cent, had moved more than
250 feet. These longest movements were: 680 feet, adult female,
26 months; 680 feet, adult female, 10 months; 680 feet, subadult
male, one year; 650 feet, young to adult male, 22 months; 640 feet,
subadult to adult female, two years; 535 feet, young male, 11
months; 510 feet, adult male, 11 months; 490 feet, young (sex undetermined),
10 months; 450 feet, young male, 13 months; 350 feet,
young (sex undetermined), 10<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> months; 335 feet, adult female
13<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> months; 275 feet, adult male, 35 months; 275 feet, adult male, 24
months; 270 feet, young to adult male, 12<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> months.</p>

<p>For those skinks caught on only two occasions, at different places,
the single movement record provides some clue as to the location
and size of the home range. No evidence was obtained to indicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
that the activities of these lizards center at fixed home bases. It may
be assumed that any two successive captures of the same individual
separated by a substantial time interval, will be distributed at random
to each other within the area to which the animal&rsquo;s activities are
confined. The varied techniques of capture, by hand and with
different types of traps, would help to secure random distribution
of capture sites. If the home range were covered uniformly by
the animal in the course of its activities, any two random capture
sites would be on the average separated by a distance equal to half
the home range diameter. If the animal tends to concentrate its
activities in the central part of the home range, as seems to be the
case, the capture sites will be correspondingly closer together. For
the 196 skinks that were caught on only two occasions, average
movement was 62 feet. Within this group the 42 adult males that
were recaptured only once had averaged movements of 58 feet.
One had made an exceptionally long movement of 510 feet, which
obviously was not entirely within its home range. Excluding this
one long movement, the remaining 41 had moved on the average,
approximately 47 feet (<a href="#Table_15">Table 15</a>). Among the other skinks caught
only twice one of 61 females and 8 of 93 young had likewise made
such long shifts that it seemed inadvisable to include them in computing
the size of the home range.</p>

<p>Distance between points of capture showed little correlation with
elapsed time. For 24 of the adult males that were recaptured in the
same year they were originally marked, the average distance was 49
feet, whereas in the 17 others recaptured after one or more hibernations
the average movement was 45 feet. For adult females, the
corresponding figures were, respectively, 22 feet and 29 feet; and
for young, 33 feet and 66 feet.</p>

<p>For those individuals recaptured twice, at different locations, the
three points of capture show to a greater or lesser degree the position,
and, in part, the extent of the home range. Of course, all
three points may be concentrated near the center of the home range,
or they all may be scattered along its edges. In general, however,
each point will lie somewhere between the center and edge of the
home range, separated from each of the other two points by a distance
of, on the average, approximately a home range radius.</p>

<p><a href="#Table_15">Table 15</a> shows that adult males and young tend to range more
widely than adult females, and that young tend to shift to new areas
more frequently than do adults. Many of the recorded movements
(in addition to the long ones that were excluded from the home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
range computations) may have involved short shifts in ranges.
If all such shifts could be definitely identified and eliminated from
the computations, actual home ranges might be considerably smaller
than those indicated by the present set of data. Home ranges
approximately 90 feet across for adult males and young, and a little
more than 30 feet across for females are indicated. Actual area of
a home range would amount to only a fraction of an acre&mdash;from
about one-seventh to less than one-fiftieth. The dash of an alarmed
skink to a place of refuge, though involving at most only a few
seconds, may traverse a large part of its home range. Through
long association the lizard is thoroughly familiar with the terrain,
so that it can take full advantage of the peculiar features in escaping,
hunting, traveling or resting.</p>

<p>Sizes of home ranges are affected by the type of habitat. For
instance, the pond rock pile approximately 70 &#215; 30 feet, must have
constituted the entire home range for the many individuals living in
it, since it was surrounded by areas that did not provide suitable
habitat. No less than 212 five-lined skinks were taken in this small
rock pile area in four seasons, and it is obvious that many of these
were occupying it simultaneously since a substantial proportion of
the total were caught there in more than one year. This rock pile
provided in particularly concentrated form the essential habitat requirements,
such as an abundant and varied arthropod food supply,
an almost infinitely large number of hiding places beneath and between
the rocks, basking sites, and flat rocks with damp soil beneath,
suitable for nests. In open woods home ranges tend to be larger or,
at least, more elongate. Scattered distribution of such habitat features
as flat rocks and outcrops, stumps, logs, and glades with patches
of sunlight, may induce an individual to extend its activities over a
more extensive area. For some of the adult males for which largest
numbers of records are available, showing repeated movements
back and forth within a definite area which seemingly constituted
a home range, movements of 275 feet, 225 feet, 170 feet, 165 feet,
150 feet and 130 feet, respectively, have been recorded. For one
young which grew to the size of a subadult during the period
covered by the records, movements within a 150-foot diameter were
recorded. These individuals all had home ranges substantially
larger than the average. It seems that in the five-lined skink there
is no fixed size or shape for a home range, but that it varies within
rather wide limits depending on age, sex, and perhaps individual
peculiarities and on the presence and distribution of essential habitat
features within the general area.</p>

<p>Most of the young that were recaptured had grown to subadult
or adult size, so that the movements they made as young cannot be
separated from those made when they were full grown or nearly so.
For 40, however, recapture records are available while they were
still less than 56 mm. long. One of those was an exceptionally long
movement of 215 feet, obviously involving a shift of range. For the
other 39, the average movement was 34 feet, almost intermediate
between the average movements of adult males and females. Observations
on recently hatched young have given the impression that
they keep to narrowly limited areas probably only a few yards in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
extent at first. For instance, at various times several members of a
brood of young have been observed foraging simultaneously but
independently on the same 10-foot log, within a few feet of each
other. For periods of up to more than a week they had failed to
disperse any farther than this from the nest, although probably
never returning to the nest itself after having left. In subsequent
weeks, however, the young are likely to shift their activities from
the immediate vicinity of the nest site to more favorable nearby
areas, and gradually extend their ranges. By the time they are one-fourth
grown they are ranging over areas larger than those used by
adult females.</p>

<p>Some of the shifts in range are probably forced upon individual
skinks by changes in seasonal distribution of food, shelter and other
requirements, causing them to abandon certain areas and invade
others by gradual stages, without venturing far, at any time, into
unfamiliar surroundings. Occasional individuals apparently get lost
and undergo a period of wandering before they re-establish a home
range. An individual venturing slightly beyond the border of its
home range might lose its orientation and fail to return, especially if
it left under conditions of stress, as when pursued by an enemy, or a
rival of its own species. Several individuals originally captured in
the vicinity of the quarry or nearby ledges, were subsequently recaptured
at the pond rock pile more than 200 yards away. In
these instances it may be that the lizard wandered from its home
range along the ledge, and finding itself in thick woods, with nearly
continuous canopy permitting insufficient sunlight, and with few
rocks for shelter, it continued down the slope to the lower edge of
the woods, crossed a ditch, and a 100-foot stretch of grassland, and
finally reached the exceptionally favorable habitat provided by the
rock pile.</p>

<p>The extent to which memory persists through the season of
dormancy is little known, but great change takes place in the
habitat during the colder half of the year when the lizard&rsquo;s activity
is suspended. Even if the area is one that is free from gross
disturbance by man or large animals, the changes occurring are so
great that the area might be scarcely recognizable from the lizard&rsquo;s
viewpoint. Herbaceous vegetation mantling the soil, at the height
of its development in late summer, will have died, dried out and the
leaves and stalks will have been matted down by wind, rain, and
snow, and incorporated in the surface layer of soil by the next spring.
Shrubs and trees having shed their leaves, present contours quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
different from those in autumn. Holes and crevices familiar as
avenues of escape, will have been sealed, by the weather collecting
and compacting surface debris. Less extensive changes are involved
in the occasional blowing down of trees and dead snags, erosion of
gullies, deposition of sediment and drift wood, and disintegration of
logs. Many of the invertebrates which are the main food sources
in late summer, are unavailable in early spring, being at different
stages in the life cycle or annual cycle of abundance; and those
kinds which make up the bulk of the spring diet likewise are often
unavailable in fall. These changes in location of food supply,
shelter, and other needs, and the seasonal change in microhabitat,
breaking the established routine of conditioned responses to habitat
features would seem to promote shifts in range after emergence
from hibernation. The available records tend to bear out this
supposition. Of the 15 skinks recorded as making long movements
of more than 250 feet that almost certainly involved shift in range,
only one was recaptured the same season; the other fourteen had
passed one or more hibernations.</p>

<p>In the course of the study approximately 30 individuals were released
or accidentally escaped at places other than the locations
where they were originally taken. Some of these were young
hatched in the laboratory, some were of unknown origin, their locality
tags having been lost before release while they were being
handled in the laboratory, or escaped from defective cloth bags
while they were awaiting processing or release, and some taken on
remote parts of the Reservation or nearby land were deliberately
released on one of the study areas with the idea that they would replace
skinks of the same sex and age, recently eliminated through
an accident of trapping or handling. Ten were released in Skink
Woods, ten at the pond rock pile, eight at the laboratory building,
and two near Rat Ledge. In no instance was a transferred skink
known to have found its way back to an original home range, although
some might have done so with fairly short trips of only a few
hundred feet, and the chances of recapturing them would have been
good. Therefore it seems that homing instinct is either wholly lacking
or but feebly developed. The incidence of recaptures was low,
only four for the entire group, suggesting a tendency to wander
away from the area of release before settling down on a home range.
One young found on May 11, 1950, in the laboratory where it probably
had escaped, was released in Skink Woods, and was recaptured
three times in the summer of 1951, in what seemed to be a
home range within 80 feet of the point of release. Another young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of unknown origin released in Skink Woods on May 18, 1950, was
recaptured six days later 160 feet away. Five hatchlings from a
clutch of eggs incubated and hatched in the laboratory, were released
in Skink Woods on August 8, 1952. The following April two
of them were recaptured, only 20 feet and 25 feet respectively, from
the point of release. The movements and dispersal of this group
from the point of release probably paralleled that of a typical brood
dispersing from its nest after hatching under natural conditions.
An adult male captured just off the Reservation was released at the
pond rock pile on May 15, 1952, and was recaptured there on June 2
and June 4. In general, skinks transferred from their original location
seem soon to settle down in a new range if the habitat is favorable,
but establishment of a home range may or may not be preceded
by an initial period of wandering.</p>


<h2>Food Habits</h2>

<p>McCauley (1939:151) examined contents of 25 alimentary tracts
of <i>E. fasciatus</i> collected in Maryland as the basis for the most extensive
account of the food habits yet published. One tract contained
a broken <i>Eumeces</i> tail, possibly that of the lizard that ate it,
which had a recently broken stump tail. A half-grown skink contained
numerous <i>Eumeces</i> scales, and McCauley interpreted this as
indicating that it had fed on another of its own species or of <i>E.
laticeps</i>. As no other hard parts of the assumed victim were in evidence,
these scales may have been the lizard&rsquo;s own slough. (In the
present study it was found that eating of the slough was far more
frequent than cannibalism.) Arthropod prey included: 11 orthopterans
(4 undetermined, 3 unspecified grasshoppers, 2 gryllids, 1
blattid, 1 acridid); 10 coleopterans (7 undetermined, 1 each of
rhynchophoran, cerambycid, carabid, staphylinid larva, elaterid
adult and larva); 8 spiders; 5 pulmonate snails; 5 flies; 3 undetermined;
and one each of lepidopteran larva and adult, ant, dragonfly,
thysanuran, and sow bug.</p>

<p>In Ohio, Conant (1940:31) noted food items consisting largely
of grasshopper nymphs and small beetles. He found that in captivity
these skinks would eat mealworms, crickets, grasshoppers,
spiders, roaches, and newborn mice, and a few individuals would
lap egg from a mixture of chopped meat and eggs. One large male
killed and ate a small common swift (<i>Sceloporus undulatus</i>). Netting
(1939:162) mentioned newborn mice, birds&rsquo; eggs and small
lizards as possible prey, although stating that this species is mainly
insectivorous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Taylor (1936:61) describing the feeding habits of lizards of
this genus wrote: &ldquo;The food consists of a very extensive variety of
insects and insect larvae, Arachnida and occasionally small crustaceans.
In a few specimens traces of plant material have been observed,
but I regard this as being most probably of accidental introduction
in the diet. Probably the most surprising fact about the
diet of the forms examined is that ants are absent.&rdquo; In the present
study of <i>E. fasciatus</i>, the trends in general bore out Taylor&rsquo;s findings
concerning absence of ants from the diet, although three ants
were found among more than 600 other food items. These three,
one of them a larva, were of the two largest species among the many
kinds of ants found in the area of the study. Most of these local
kinds of ants are below the minimum size of prey ordinarily taken
by the skinks. Colonies of small ants, <i>Aphenogaster</i> sp., for instance,
are abundant in the soil beneath flat rocks in the same situations
where the skinks are found, and constitute most of the food of
the small toads, <i>Microhyla olivacea</i>, which were abundant in the
same habitat and microhabitat as the skinks, especially in the Skink
Woods study area (Freiburg, 1951:383).</p>

<p>Burt (1928:56) without citing specific records, stated that &ldquo;The
food of <i>E. fasciatus</i> consists largely of insects and spiders,&rdquo; but in
another paper (1928:62) he listed contents of two stomachs, including
a wood roach (<i>Parcoblatta</i>), a cricket (<i>Gryllus pennsylvanicus</i>),
a grasshopper, and 2 spiders (attid and lycosid). Smith,
summarizing the findings of other authors (1946:350), stated that
&ldquo;The food consists of various small insects, insect larvae, earthworms,
spiders, etc. Small vertebrates such as young lizards and mice are
sometimes eaten.&rdquo; In a later work Smith (1950:188) altered this
statement slightly: &ldquo;The food consists of almost any small moving
animal, including many kinds of arthropods and even small vertebrates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many authors have mentioned predation on mammals by these
skinks, but without citing specific instances, which must be rare
indeed, for the smallest newborn mice seem to be near the maximum
size of objects that could possibly be swallowed by the largest
adults of the common five-lined skink. Various early records and
statements pertaining to predation on small vertebrates by five-lined
skinks probably pertain in most cases to <i>E. laticeps</i>, which is much
larger than <i>E. fasciatus</i>, and more powerful.</p>

<p>Barbour (1950:102) recorded stomach contents of an <i>E. fasciatus</i>
collected in Harlan County, Kentucky, as consisting of 60 per cent
Arachnida, 30 per cent adult Lepidoptera, and 10 per cent ants, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
volume. Werler and McCallion (1951:250) mentioned that on two
occasions these skinks in Virginia were seen to eat tenebrionid
beetles and larvae.</p>

<p>Webb (1949:294) fed captive skinks with field crickets (<i>Gryllus</i>)
and noted that the lizards tended to seize them by the pronotum,
and then worked forward to the head, chewing vigorously to disable
them. The seized crickets attempted to defend themselves by
striking the lizards&rsquo; faces and eyes with the cerci and tibial spines.
Webb also offered his skinks newly hatched snails, <i>Helix aspersa</i>,
which were noticed and fed upon when they moved. In one instance,
he noted that a skink found a quiescent snail, and swallowed
it after testing it with the tongue a few times.</p>

<p>McIlhenny (1937:232) has published a remarkable account of
observations on the foraging behavior of a large adult male skink
(stated to be <i>E. fasciatus</i> but almost certainly <i>E. laticeps</i>) in
southern Louisiana, which climbed among vines on the side of a
house and attacked nests of wasps, <i>Polistes pallipes</i> and <i>P. bellicosus</i>,
shaking out the larvae, pausing to crush and swallow the few adults
that lit on it and attempted, unsuccessfully, to sting. After many
larvae had been shaken to the ground the skink descended and
made a leisurely search, eating them in seemingly prodigious quantities.
Several times it climbed back into the vines to shake out
more larvae, and each time retrieved from the ground those it could
find. After feeding to repletion it returned to its habitual shelter
in a hollow live oak fifty feet from the house. In a two-week period,
however, it returned frequently to raid the wasp nests in the vines,
and eventually it had attacked all of the 32 nests that were originally
present, completely destroying many of them.</p>

<p>In the course of the present study direct observations on the food
habits of skinks rarely could be made in the field. Most of those
seen had been alarmed by the presence of the observer, and already
had begun a dash for shelter. Others not sufficiently alarmed to
take cover, were affected by an observer&rsquo;s presence, so that usually
they ceased their normal activities and crouched attempting to
conceal themselves or slithered nervously from one vantage point
to another, on the alert for any sign of danger.</p>

<p>On September 1, 1951, a young skink (30-35 mm. snout-vent
length) was discovered on the cement walk just outside the laboratory
building, holding a cricket (<i>Nemobius</i>) which evidently it had
just caught. When I came out of the building, the skink, alarmed,
ran about ten feet, holding the cricket by one leg. The cricket was
still alive but was nearly immobilized, except for twitching of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
antennae and mandibles, and evidently it had already been shaken
and battered. After maneuvering about the cement walk the skink
ran through the open door into the building. Though seeming to
be uneasy at my proximity it was still mainly intent on subduing
and swallowing its prey. Following, I caused the skink to take
alarm. It dashed back through the door to the walk outside and
still carrying the cricket, it ran along the walk to the steps leading
up to another building and climbed onto the first step where its
uneasiness soon subsided. The cricket was remarkably large in
proportion to the skink itself, being of approximately the same
diameter, with a length nearly half that of the skink&rsquo;s snout-vent
length. Nevertheless, in about five minutes the skink had swallowed
it entire. As swallowing began, on the cement step, the skink was
in bright sunshine of early afternoon. In less than a minute it
seemed to become overheated, and dragged the prey back several
inches into shadow. While swallowing was still in progress, it
again ran forward till its anterior half was in sunshine, seemingly
regulating its body temperature by these frequent shifts.</p>

<p>A similar encounter between a larger juvenile and a cricket
(<i>Ceuthophilus</i>) was observed on May 9, 1953. After I had stood
for several minutes beside a rock ledge in woods, my attention was
attracted by a rustling sound in dry leaves. The skink, emerging
onto the ledge from a cavity beneath exposed hackberry roots
had its head raised high and was darting about, peering into crevices
and examining its surroundings with unusual animation. After
several seconds the cricket hopped into view. Possibly it had been
injured already, as it moved deliberately, with short hops. Instantly
the skink darted in pursuit, following its erratic course persistently,
as it made several hops. In a few seconds the skink caught the
cricket, bit it vigorously, and battered it against the rock ledge
with violent lateral shaking. Several times the cricket was knocked
from the skink&rsquo;s jaws, but each time it was quickly retrieved. In a
few seconds its struggles were subdued, but the skink continued to
worry it, dropping it and retrieving it dozens of times. The skink
seized the cricket by one of the large rear legs, which was snapped
off with a sudden vigorous shake. The skink then dropped and
lost the detached leg, and ran back to seize the cricket again. The
performance was repeated with several other legs and the antennae,
until most of the appendages were eliminated and the body was
softened by continued biting and chewing. Then although the
cricket was of body diameter almost as great as the skink itself,
the lizard swallowed it head first, engulfing it with violent gulping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
movements. After the front end of the prey had entered the gullet,
muscles of the throat and neck were brought into play in forcing
it farther down. Swallowing movements were snake-like, the lizard
turning its head at right angles to the body to squeeze the
morsel down.</p>

<p>At the pond rock pile on May 7, 1952, a small adult male was
watched as it moved about over the rocks. A lycosid spider
(<i>Pardosa lapidicina</i>) carrying an egg sac was basking on an inclined
rock surface. When the skink had come within a few inches,
it made a sudden rush at the spider which escaped easily. As
this common rock-living spider can move with almost incredible
speed, skinks probably do not often catch them in the open.</p>

<p>Captive skinks, in taking their food, seem to rely much less than
some other lizards on movement of the prey as a means of detecting
it. An active and hungry skink often failed to notice a spider or
insect moving about on the opposite side of the terrarium a foot
or more away. However, on many occasions, skinks moving about
the terrarium and coming upon a motionless prey item have been
seen to stop and examine it intently for several seconds, then grasp
it, often in a tentative and hesitant manner, after testing it with the
tongue. Sight and scent seem to be about equally important in
prey recognition, each supplementing the other, and often functioning
simultaneously. As many of the animals preyed upon are
secretive and would seldom be found in the open by day, it seems
that much of the prey is found in hiding places&mdash;in leaf litter on the
forest floor, beneath flat rocks or at their edges, and in chinks and
crannies of decaying logs, stumps, and tree trunks. Some of the
prey animals taken are of types that are more active and swift than
the skinks themselves. Presumably the olfactory sense is the more
important in detecting prey that is motionless or concealed. Stebbins
(1948:202) studied the nasal structure of <i>Eumeces</i>, and compared
it with that of other lizards. He concluded that the extensive
mucus-secreting and olfactory surfaces suggest relatively
efficient humidification of inspired air and efficient olfaction in
lizards of this genus. In captivity five-lined skinks thrived when
provided with ample moisture and shelter and food and kept
within the proper temperature range. The reactions of these captive
skinks to various small animals introduced into their terraria provided
clues as to their food preferences, but also were misleading in
some instances. On many occasions hatchlings and young of various
sizes were kept with adults of both sexes and subadults, but no
instances of cannibalism were ever recorded in captivity. No
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
hostility was seen except between adults, mainly in the breeding
season. Young of the little brown skink, <i>Scincella laterale</i>, kept
with adult <i>E. fasciatus</i>, and small enough to be eaten by them, likewise
were unmolested. Small snakes such as <i>Diadophis</i>, <i>Carphophis</i>,
and <i>Storeria</i> placed in terraria with the skinks evoked no strong
reaction. Occasionally mild avoidance reactions were aroused but
the skinks were never seen to display any hostility and readily
became accustomed to such cage mates. Mealworms, the most
readily available food for the captive skinks, were generally accepted
by those that were hungry and sufficiently warm, but were taken
with little enthusiasm. They were seldom noticed unless the skinks
were within a few inches. Skinks sometimes tested them with
their tongues and examined them intently then moved away without
eating them. Earthworms, offered on several occasions, were
not eaten. Harvestmen, seemingly of the same kind as those found
in scats, were ignored by some captive individuals and taken by
others but with some signs of distaste. Ants were ignored. Scarabaeid
beetles, that seemed small enough to be eaten, were attacked
unsuccessfully, as they were too heavily armored to be crushed in
the skinks&rsquo; jaws. Wasps (<i>Polistes</i>) placed in terraria were avoided,
as were carabid beetles and reduviid bugs. A spider placed in the
terrarium usually aroused one or more skinks to animated pursuit,
as soon as it moved. Even spiders that seemed to be too large to
be swallowed were sometimes pursued and attacked. Occasionally
freshly killed prey was taken, especially spiders and wasp larvae.
Of invertebrates minute forms are not taken, while certain ants, and
various others of the kinds of insects most common on the study
areas and often found rather closely associated with the skinks and
using the same shelters, were never represented among the recorded
food items. Carabid beetles (<i>Brachinus</i>, <i>Calosoma</i>, <i>Lebia</i>,
<i>Harpalus</i>, <i>Pasimachus</i>), and reduviid bugs (<i>Melanolestes</i>, etc.)
seemed to be especially abundant and available, but habitually
avoided possibly because of their noxious qualities. Diptera were
entirely absent from the sample in the present study&mdash;they and
many other insects are so much quicker than the skinks that ordinarily
these insects cannot be caught. Foliage-living insects and
those that are strong and persistent fliers, are rarely available as prey.</p>

<p>A total of 738 food items were recorded in the present study.
Arachnids with 360 items, and insects with 319, together made up
92 percent of these food items. There were 334 spiders (most were
not definitely identified, but four were thomisids, 40 were lycosids,
and 79 were salticids, the latter group including 27 of the genus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
<i>Phidippus</i>); 26 harvestmen (<i>Leiobunum vittatum</i> and others); 149
orthopterans (51 ceuthophilid crickets, 31 gryllid crickets, 27 tettigoniid
locusts; 17 unspecified, 14 roaches, 9 locustid grasshoppers);
80 indeterminate insects; 39 beetles (mostly carabids and
scarabaeids within a narrow size range); 19 larvae (13 lepidopteran,
2 coleopteran, 1 ant, 3 indeterminate); 2 ants (<i>Camponotus herculaneus</i>
and <i>C. castaneus</i>); 2 wasps; 1 moth; 1 centipede; 59 snails
(31 indeterminate, 18 <i>Gastrocopta armifera</i>, 8 <i>Retinella electrina</i>,
1 <i>Strobilops labyrynthica</i>, 1 <i>Hawaia minuscula</i>); 23 sloughed skins
of the skinks themselves; 2 skink eggs; and 2 skink hatchlings.</p>

<p>This sample is based on combined sets of data from analysis of
stomach contents and of &ldquo;scats.&rdquo; The two sets of data present somewhat
divergent trends, and perhaps neither is adequately representative
of the food habits in the geographic area represented. A total
of 620 food items found in scats represented an average of 1.67
items per scat, whereas in 80 stomachs containing food the average
was 1.44 items per stomach. Of the skinks killed and dissected
more than half had empty stomachs. Many of them were, however,
found inactive in shelter so that it was obvious that they had not
foraged recently. Many were not killed immediately and they may
have had time to digest any food in their stomachs.</p>

<p>Determinations of the prey down to species were possible in relatively
few instances; usually only the family or the order could be
determined. Those who have attempted food habits studies of insectivorous
small vertebrates will appreciate the obstacles encountered.
The invertebrates available to the skinks in the area of the
study included many thousands of species. A large number of these
species, perhaps the majority, belong to groups still not thoroughly
studied, so that their taxonomy is in a state of confusion. Ordinarily
the prey is crushed in the jaws and battered on the ground before
ingestion; diagnostic structures are often broken or lost, making
identification far more difficult. Prey animals taken are often in
immature or larval stages which lack the distinguishing features
presented by adults. Even the combined efforts of a team of specialists
on each of the prey groups involved probably would not
have sufficed to obtain generic and specific identification of every
item found. In the present study, however, all determinations were
made by the writer, with the aid of the small reference collection
at the University of Kansas Natural History Reservation.</p>

<p>The 80 specimens used for stomach contents analysis nearly all
came from localities off the Reservation, but all within a ten-mile
radius thereof. A dozen localities were represented by these specimens,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and within each locality specimens were taken in somewhat
different situations. Therefore the stomach contents analyzed represents
a wide range of ecological conditions, including many different
microhabitats. All the stomach contents were collected in
late April, May, and June&mdash;within the first half of the skinks&rsquo; active
season. Trends might be expected to differ in late summer and fall.</p>

<p>The food items from stomachs included: 38 spiders (8 of the
salticid genus <i>Phidippus</i>, 5 lycosids, 4 thomisids, and the remainder
unspecified); 15 insect larvae (7 of them lepidopteran and one tentatively
identified as an ant, <i>Camponotus castaneus</i>, the rest unspecified);
13 unspecified insects; 10 crickets; 9 roaches; 9 snails (5 of
them <i>Gastrocopta armifera</i>); 7 beetles; 4 sloughs of skinks; 3 grasshoppers;
2 grouse locusts; and one each of cave cricket (<i>Ceuthophilus?</i>),
ant (<i>Camponotus castaneus</i>), moth, centipede, sow bug,
and egg of a skink. The egg was probably laid by the female that
ate it, since she was found brooding an unusually small clutch of
only three eggs.</p>

<p>The condition of food items found in stomachs varied greatly.
Some were nearly intact, while others were fragmentary and represented
by only a few of the more durable and indigestible parts.
The larvae of various insects found in stomachs examined are especially
noteworthy, since but little comparable material was found
in the much larger group of items identified from scats.</p>

<p>The scatological material was even less satisfactory than the
stomach material in providing determinable food items. The scats
of these skinks are, roughly, 10 to 20 mm. long and two to four mm.
in diameter, usually cylindrical and almost straight, and capped at
one end with a white chalky deposit of uric acid. Superficially they
have some resemblance to bird droppings, but are different in texture.
The uric acid deposit is loose and crumbly, and much less
compact than that with bird feces, and the food residue is much less
completely disintegrated than is similar material in feces of birds.
Common small snakes which might produce feces of similar size,
include the ring-necked snake (<i>Diadophis punctatus</i>), the worm
snake (<i>Carphophis amoenus</i>), and DeKay&rsquo;s snake (<i>Storeria dekayi</i>),
but their feces have a much higher moisture content, lack the definite
shape of the skink scats, and ordinarily do not contain readily
recognizable residue of the prey. The six other species of lizards on
the Reservation, the collared lizard (<i>Crotaphytus collaris</i>), brown
skink (<i>Scincella laterale</i>), prairie skink (<i>Eumeces septentrionalis</i>),
Sonoran skink (<i>E. obsoletus</i>), six-lined racerunner (<i>Cnemidophorus
sexlineatus</i>) and glass &ldquo;snake&rdquo; (<i>Ophisaurus attenuatus</i>) might produce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
scats indistinguishable from those of the five-lined skink.
However, none of these lizards except the relatively rare and secretive
brown skink, occurred in either of the two situations where
most of the scats were collected and it is highly improbable that
the scat collection included any material from species other than
the five-lined skink.</p>

<p>The scats consist mainly of chitinous fragments of arthropod prey.
Usually the prey fragments are so well comminuted, mixed, and
scattered that reconstruction is difficult. Degree of disintegration
differs greatly, depending not only on the type of prey eaten, but
probably also on the condition and temperature of the lizard, and
the amount of other food in its digestive tract. Arthropods which
have recently undergone ecdysis and have the exoskeleton still thin
and soft are no doubt digested much more completely than those
that have more heavily sclerotized parts. In spiders the chelicerae
are more resistant to digestion than are other parts of the exoskeleton,
and frequently appear, intact or nearly so, in the scat contents.
The fangs being even more resistant, were sometimes found separately
when no other cheliceral parts were recognizably preserved.
Frequently large fragments of the carapace, with some of the eyes
or all of them, were found. Spider abdomens sometimes were distinguishable,
but were collapsed and compressed. Spider legs conspicuous
in most of the scats, were so broken, tangled, and distorted
that they were of little diagnostic value. In harvestmen, dorsal
shields were nearly always fairly intact; but only small fragments of
the elongate slender legs were found and they were mostly broken
off when the attacking skinks battered the phalangid against the
ground before swallowing it. The horny outer wings of crickets,
roaches, and beetles usually were in recognizable though fragmentary
condition. Occasional heads of insects often were found fairly
intact. Insect legs were sometimes intact, sometimes broken into
sections or crushed and fragmented. The thorax was usually represented
by scattered fragments of chitin, and the abdomen by the
separate chitin bands of each body segment.</p>

<p>Shells of snails were sometimes found nearly intact in the scats,
although showing the effect of the digestive juices in their extreme
brittleness. In other instances all that remained of the shell was
the inner columella, and small scattered fragments.</p>

<p>Certain of the items eaten were probably so thoroughly digested
as to leave either no hard parts at all, or minute and nondescript
parts that were not recognized. The common small slug <i>Deroceras
laeve</i>, for instance, would seem to be just as suitable and available
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
for food as the various kinds of snails, but it was not recorded in
either stomachs or scats. Having no hard parts except the vestigial
internal shell, it probably would not be recognized in scats, even
though it had been eaten. Various insect larvae, having thin outer
cuticles and virtually no hard sclerotized structures except in the
head, likewise probably would leave no recognizable parts. Molted
skin of the skinks themselves seemed to be little altered by the
digestive processes.</p>

<p>The collection of 371 skink scats originated mainly from two
places on the Reservation nearly three-quarters of a mile apart, the
pond rock pile and an old wooden bridge across a ravine. On the
weathered planks of the bridge, the scats were conspicuous and
could be easily gathered in quantity. At the pond rock pile, where
skinks were especially abundant and were intensively studied, their
scats were frequently noticed on the large rocks where they hunted
and basked. A third smaller collection of scats was made in the
vicinity of the laboratory buildings and adjacent rock walk frequented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
by a few skinks. A small number of additional scats were
collected elsewhere on the Reservation, but ordinarily the scats
were so inconspicuous in the woodland situations where skinks
occurred under typical habitat conditions, that few were found. The
rock pile, bridge, and vicinity of buildings are not typical of the
species&rsquo; habitat and might offer somewhat different choices of prey
items.</p>

<p>The 30 scat collections were made in 1951 and 1952. Seasonally,
the sample of scats overlapped but little the sample of stomach
contents, and was concentrated in the latter half of the growing
season. The distribution by months was as follows: April-2; May-38;
June-60; July-29; August-213; September-26. Most of the scats
probably were deposited within a few days of the time they were
collected, because scats disintegrate and disappear rapidly in the
field where they are exposed to rain, wind and dung-feeding insects.</p>

<p>No clearly defined seasonal trends are revealed in <a href="#Table_16">Table 16</a> but
the monthly samples, except that for August, are scarcely adequate
for this purpose. Approximately equal numbers of scats were collected
at the two main stations, the pond rock pile and the bridge,
but some kinds of items were unequally represented in the two
samples.</p>

<p>Spiders, harvestmen, and snails were well represented in both
samples. In the bridge sample, salticids (especially <i>Phidippus
audax</i>), grouse locusts, and the snail <i>Gastrocopta</i> were more
numerous. In the rock pile sample lycosids, and especially ceuthophilid
crickets were more abundant. The ceuthophilids were notably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
numerous among the rocks, and many of them were caught
in the wire funnel traps placed there for skinks.</p>

<p>Little is known concerning the quantitative food requirement of
any kind of lizard. Five-lined skinks fast for at least half the year
during the period of dormancy, from September to April. When
they emerge from dormancy in spring most of them are plump and
appear to have lost little weight in the course of their long fast.
In the season of activity, obviously the quantity of food consumed
fluctuates according to temperature and activity of the lizard. Most
of the prey taken falls within a fairly narrow size range. The prey
ordinarily is swallowed entire or nearly so. This imposes a definite
upper size limit. The skink of course lacks the ophidian capacity to
ingest relatively enormous objects. The mental symphysis and
pectoral girdle would prevent ingestion of an object much larger
than the skink&rsquo;s body diameter, but soft-bodied and flexible arthropods
of body diameter approximately equal to that of the skink
may be ingested. Typical food items are of such size that from one
to three of them fill the stomach to capacity. On one occasion, in
an attempt to feed a brood of young recently hatched in the laboratory,
I dropped into their jar a mass of newly hatched house spiders
(<i>Theridion tepidariorum</i>). As these minute spiders swarmed
over and around the skinks, the lizards gave little heed to them except
occasionally to jerk or scratch in irritation. One skink, however,
was seen to snap up a spider which ran near its snout. The
adult female <i>Theridion</i> from the same web was then introduced
into the skinks&rsquo; jar, although it seemed too large prey for these
small lizards, as its abdomen was fully as large as their body diameter.
When it ran, the hatchling skinks immediately became alert
and several chased it biting at it in frantic excitement. They had
difficulty in grasping its smooth rounded surface, but eventually
one did catch it and eat it. Full-grown mealworms averaging 26
mm. in length, and approximately .11 grams, are somewhat smaller
than the usual prey of adults. In captivity hungry adult skinks
took from one to nine such mealworms at a meal. However, they
could not be induced to feed daily over periods of weeks, even when
kept at high temperatures. Over a period of 64 days an adult male
kept at approximately 80&#176; F. in the daytime and 10 to 15 degrees
lower at night, ate a total of 30 mealworms, which, in the aggregate,
weighed approximately 42 per cent of his body weight. In 35 days
under the same conditions an adult female ate 24 mealworms, approximately
32 per cent of her body weight.</p>

<h2>Predation and Parasitism</h2>

<h3 class="smcap">Escape Reactions</h3>

<p>Like other members of the family Scincidae, <i>Eumeces fasciatus</i>
tends to be secretive in its habits and it depends on concealment
rather than speed, aggressive behavior, or noxious qualities to escape
its enemies. As compared with lizards in general, or with
other members of the genus <i>Eumeces</i>, five-lined skinks are relatively
unspecialized in their behavior, and retain a good deal of
versatility. While primarily terrestrial, they are able to burrow
and climb. Their reactions toward prey and natural enemies vary
greatly according to circumstances.</p>

<p>They are less secretive than many other kinds of skinks. Nevertheless
the numbers active on the ground surface at any one time,
even under the most favorable weather conditions, probably are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
only a fraction of the total population. For instance, in two or three
hours of intensive search in Skink Woods, in which almost every
square yard of the area was inspected, a dozen skinks constituted an
unusually good catch. Seldom were as many as 20 seen&mdash;and most
of these only when uncovered in their hiding places. At the pond
rock pile, often half a dozen or even more could be seen simultaneously
or within the course of a few minutes, as they basked or
darted about over the rock surface. These, however, represented
only a small part of the number known to occur in the rock pile,
which could be observed in its entirety from one spot. At other
times, especially in late summer and early fall, even when weather
seemed favorable, cursory search of each of the study areas failed
to reveal a single individual. Presumably at such times the majority
of individuals of the dense population were sheltered deep
underground in relatively inaccessible hiding places. Others which
escaped attention may have been climbing on tree trunks or logs,
or may have been foraging on the ground but close to hiding places
into which they darted undetected. The habit of &ldquo;freezing&rdquo; in
response to a potential danger is commonly noticed in these skinks,
and usually it is effective in concealing them.</p>

<p>Having elongate bodies and short limbs, five-lined skinks are not
especially swift of foot, but the jerkiness of their movements provides
compensatory elusiveness. One sufficiently warm to be fully
active is nervous in its actions. Even when resting or basking it is
likely to shift its position frequently, fidgeting, blinking, and panting,
obviously on the alert for any sign of danger. In moving about,
it usually progresses only a few steps at a time, with frequent
pauses sometimes only a fraction of a second in duration. These
numerous stops allow the animal to examine the terrain immediately
ahead of it, and perhaps avoid blundering within reach of a lurking
enemy.</p>

<p>Ontogenetic change in the color pattern is of significance in
connection with the secretive habits. The red facial suffusion of the
breeding male renders him more conspicuous in his natural surroundings,
but this bright color is ephemeral. It is developed as
a warning, for display to other males. Otherwise, in the adult
male the color of dull brown is inconspicuous in its natural surroundings,
usually against a background of leaf litter, dead stems,
and soil. In the juvenile the contrasting pattern of dark brown
ground-color, five longitudinal light stripes, and a vivid blue tail,
is far more conspicuous. The young skink might seem to be handicapped
in its chances for survival by this conspicuousness. However,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
in snakes it has been shown that a vivid striped pattern,
characteristic of forms that are fast moving and live in dense vegetation,
serves to conceal motion, and aid its possessor in confusing
and eluding pursuers. The young skinks, being far more active than
the adults, may use the striped pattern more effectively in this
way. Often when a young skink is startled in its natural surroundings,
and takes to cover, the observer does not see its
outlines at all, and is conscious of it only as a flash of blue. On
many occasions, while walking in the woods, I have had my attention
attracted by a faint rustling of dry leaves, and have received
such a fleeting impression of the flashing blue tail as to be uncertain
whether or not I had actually seen a skink, until, raising a flat
rock or other shelter, I found that one actually was present, concealing
itself in the nearby hiding place. The erratic movements
of a frightened skink that is warm and fully active, make it exceedingly
elusive. With sudden lashing movements of its heavy
tail and hindquarters, it may flip its body about, facing first in one
direction and then in another, as it pauses before or after a rush
for shelter. The sudden reversals of direction are so confusing to
the pursuer that the skink may often escape by hiding after a few
seconds of pursuit, even though the situation provides no shelter
where the lizard is entirely secure. The tail-flip described is
characteristically given at the instant the lizard reaches shelter
such as a crevice, or hole, and just before it disappears. By the instantaneous
pivoting of its body, throwing its tail in an arc, in the
direction of its original course, the lizard creates the optical
illusion of having moved beyond the point where it has taken to
shelter. The peculiar writhing movements of the tail of juveniles
that are moving about in the open accentuate the conspicuousness
of the vividly colored tail, and suggest that this conspicuousness
may be advantageous to the lizard in serving as a decoy to catch the
attention of predators and distract them from the lizard itself.</p>

<p>In hatchlings the mortality rate is high. Tails are broken
frequently in those that survive, suggesting that the tail may be
useful in diverting enemies from the lizard itself. Among 121 young
of the smallest sizes, (snout-vent lengths in the range of 23 to 29
mm.) 7.4 percent already had broken tails (not including, of course,
those in which the tails were broken while the skinks were being captured).
In slightly larger young, those in the 30-34 mm. range,
perhaps averaging one month old, nearly one-fourth had lost their
original tails. In those in the 35-55 mm. size class, mostly one to three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
months old, about half have already lost parts of their original tails.
In those that are in the size group 65-69 mm. normally attained at
an age of a year, approximately three-fourths have regenerated
tails, and in adults the proportion with unbroken tails is even
smaller&mdash;down to 16.5 percent in females of more than 75 mm.
snout-vent length. In adults the incidence of broken and regenerated
tails is slightly higher in females than in males. Defense
of nests and sluggishness in the females during the time that they
are excavating the nest burrows and guarding their eggs may
result in their tails being broken more frequently.</p>

<p>Tree-climbing is a common means of escape and it is curious
that many of those who have described the habits of <i>E. fasciatus</i>
have either failed to note it at all or have minimized arboreal habits.
Taylor (1936:59) cited two instances of tree-climbing but stated:
&ldquo;Only rarely is this form seen in trees, at least in the western part
of its range.&rdquo; Conant (1951:30) stated: &ldquo;They seldom climb trees,
contrary to the habit of <i>laticeps</i> and <i>inexpectatus</i>.&rdquo; Hudson (1942:42)
mentioned seeing an adult that escaped by climbing the side
of a hollow tree in southeastern Nebraska.</p>

<p>In the present study, tree-climbing as a means of escape was observed
frequently, probably more than two hundred times in all.
It was characteristic of both sexes and all ages, and was one of the
commonest responses to danger. In summer when skinks were
fully active, they usually moved too rapidly to be caught by hand
either in the open or where they were uncovered when I turned
over rocks or other shelter. To obtain specimens in any numbers
at such times, an understanding was essential of the somewhat
stereotyped behavior pattern involved in their escape by tree-climbing.
A skink that was alarmed in the course of its foraging or
basking on the ground litter was likely to run directly to the nearest
tree trunk, often a distance of several or many yards, and start
up it, instantly disappearing to the far side of it. The trees climbed
were usually small, two to eight inches in trunk diameter; however,
in the second growth forest where the study was made, large mature
trees were relatively scarce. Having started up the tree trunk
and concealed itself on the side opposite from its pursuer, the skink
usually stopped one to five feet from the ground and waited quietly
for the danger to pass. A vine of Virginia creeper, poison ivy,
grape or moonseed, or a shrub such as gooseberry, providing screening
foliage at the base of the tree trunk, furnished the type of sheltered
situation that the skink was most likely to choose as a stopping
place. The most effective technique for catching the lizard was to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
move slowly around the tree trunk at a distance of at least 20 or 30
feet and look for the lizard clinging to it. Having located the
lizard, the collector might take careful note of its position, then
return to the opposite side of the tree and approach, unseen, to
close range to make a sudden grab around the trunk. This ruse
often succeeded; more frequently it failed, because of the lizard&rsquo;s
adroitness in dodging, or failure of the collector to gauge its position
accurately, or a slight shifting of its position between the time
it was seen and the time when an attempt was made to catch it.
The response of the lizard to the unsuccessful attempt to seize it
depended on whether or not it was touched, and in which direction
it was driven. It might drop to the ground and burrow into leaf
litter or dash away to other shelter, or it might stay on the tree
trunk and spiral rapidly upward out of reach. Because of the
squirrel-like tendency to keep the tree trunk between it and the
pursuer, the skink usually could be relocated only after some maneuvering.
Having climbed the tree trunk to the bases of the main
branches, the skink usually showed little inclination to move out
along them but tended to hide in the crotches or to spiral back
down the trunk. Often a long stick or pole was used effectively to
drive a skink back down the trunk by touching or pushing it on the
upper side. A skink maneuvered to the lower part of the tree trunk
was never loath to leave it in a dash for other shelter, which might
be another tree trunk nearby. In moving downward or horizontally
on a tree trunk or limb, a skink allows its heavy tail to bend downward
from its own weight. The tail probably handicaps the lizard&rsquo;s
climbing to some extent, and those with short regenerated tails have
an advantage.</p>

<p>The following extracts from my field notes are selected as typical
illustrations of the climbing habit as a response to danger.</p>

<div class="smaller">
<p>September 15, 1948. A skink darted across the trail in front of me, to a tree
18 inches in diameter and climbed to a height of five feet where it stopped.
Each time that I moved to approach and examine it, the skink was disturbed,
and darted jerkily higher up the trunk until it was well out of reach at a
height of about ten feet.</p>

<p>May 2, 1949. Seeing an adult male skink lying in the open, I attempted
to stalk it, but it became alarmed, ran to a shagbark hickory about six inches
in diameter, and soon had climbed to a height of 25 feet.</p>

<p>June 4, 1949. Juvenile, basking a few inches above ground on trunk of an
elm ten inches in diameter, took alarm at my approach, and climbed rapidly
out of reach, where it concealed itself in thick foliage.</p>

<p>June 22, 1949. Movement two feet above ground on an elm sapling attracted
my attention; an adult male and a juvenal skink were clinging to the
trunk only a few inches apart, and neither moved as I approached and examined
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
them from a distance of less than three feet. The concealment afforded
by numerous short twigs with thick foliage apparently caused them to
feel secure.</p>

<p>September 21, 1949. A juvenile was noticed climbing eight feet above the
ground on a locust trunk. As I approached the skink continued upward to a
height of approximately 15 feet above the ground where it disappeared around
the trunk and could not be relocated.</p>

<p>July 7, 1950. A nearly grown juvenile ran to an elm sapling four inches in
diameter, and climbed up out of reach. When the skink reached the main
crotch, it turned facing downward alertly. By reaching up with a long stick
and poking it on the hindquarters, I succeeded several times in chasing it part
way down the trunk, but each time it ran back up to the crotch and returned
to the same position.</p>

<p>July 26, 1950. A hatchling uncovered beneath a flat rock ran to a nearby
oak tree about four inches in diameter and climbed to a height of five feet
before it was caught. An adult female seen foraging in the open ran to a dead
shrub and climbed one of the stems, inclined at an angle of about 45&#176;. Ascending
this stem she was unable to get more than three feet above the ground,
and was easily captured. Another adult female seen foraging in the open ran
to an oak about three inches in diameter, climbed rapidly to a height a little
more than a foot above the ground, and concealed herself under the stem of a
poison ivy vine twined about the tree trunk.</p>

<p>July 27, 1951. A female brooding her eggs dashed out of the nest when
the flat rock covering it was lifted, ran 15 feet to a hickory sapling and climbed
it.</p>

<p>May 1, 1952. An adult male found beneath a rock ran to a small tree ten
feet away, climbed up on the opposite side, and stopped about a foot above the
ground. My first attempt to seize it failed and it ran around the trunk and
stopped at a height of four feet. The next try was likewise unsuccessful, and
the skink dropped to the ground and burrowed into leaf litter.</p>

<p>May 15, 1952. An adult male startled as it basked in a patch of sunlight
in thick woods, dashed 25 feet without stopping, to an osage orange tree and
disappeared behind the base of the trunk. Moving to the far side of the tree
I located the skink clinging to the trunk two feet above the ground. My attempt
to catch it failed and it spiralled up the trunk to a height of ten feet.
When I poked at it with a stick, it crouched close to the trunk allowing the
stick almost to touch it, then it spiralled down the trunk and could not be
relocated.</p>

<p>June 23, 1952. When I struck the trunk of a partly dead ailanthus tree with
a brush knife to determine whether it was hollow, a juvenile darted out of a
cavity five feet above the ground, ran farther up the trunk, and disappeared into
another small hole. An adult male was seen running across the vertical wall
of a building, clinging to the rough asphalt siding. When it was alarmed it ran
to a crevice and hid.</p>
</div>

<p>A more unusual escape-reaction was observed on May 25, 1952,
at Tonganoxie State Lake, by Sydney Anderson, who recorded that
a skink, alarmed by him at the edge of the water dived and hid
among submerged rocks. Similarly, Boyer and Heinze (1934:194)
record of this species, in Jefferson County, Missouri: "When pursued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
they do not hesitate to take to the water and are very agile
swimmers over short distances at least." Parker (1948:25) wrote
that in western Tennessee <i>fasciatus</i> sometimes showed a preference
for habitat in the vicinity of water, and, if other concealment was
not available, it would usually take refuge in the water.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Natural Enemies</h3>

<p>Little is known concerning the kinds of predators that destroy
five-lined skinks, or their importance in its ecology. In studies of
the food habits of various predatory birds and mammals, workers
often have been interested chiefly in items of direct economic bearing,
and have tended to lump as &ldquo;lizard&rdquo; or &ldquo;reptile&rdquo; material that
might have included <i>Eumeces fasciatus</i>. I have been able to find
only a few specific references to predation on it. Nevertheless many
kinds of predators probably utilize it as food, at least occasionally.
Owls probably seldom have opportunity to prey on these skinks,
which are not known to be active after dark. Nestling broad-winged
hawks observed in 1954 were found to have eaten an adult and a
subadult five-lined skink on June 13 and June 23. The Cooper&rsquo;s
hawk and red-shouldered hawk also are probable predators as both
are known to feed upon small reptiles. Mammalian predators which
might be expected to take skinks occasionally include the red fox,
gray fox, bobcat, mink, weasels, skunks, opossum, armadillo, moles,
and shrews. Snakes, especially those of the genera <i>Elaphe</i>, <i>Lampropeltis</i>,
<i>Cemophora</i>, <i>Micrurus</i> and <i>Ancistrodon</i>, may include some
of the chief predators on the skink. Certain larger lizards also may
prey upon it.</p>

<p>Of these several potential predators, only the opossum, armadillo,
and snakes (<i>Elaphe obsoleta</i>, <i>E. guttata</i>, <i>Lampropeltis triangulum</i>,
<i>L. calligaster</i>, <i>L. getulus</i>, and <i>Ancistrodon contortrix</i>), Sonoran
skink and the greater five-lined skink (in confinement) have
actually been recorded as preying on <i>Eumeces fasciatus</i> but circumstantial
evidence has been obtained for the mole (<i>Scalopus
aquaticus</i>) and short-tailed shrew (<i>Blarina brevicauda</i>). The
short-tailed shrew may be one of the major predators on the skink.
This shrew prefers the same habitats and occurs throughout the
skink&rsquo;s extensive range. Like the skink, it is a characteristic inhabitant
of the hardwood forests of the eastern United States, but
its range extends farther north and west. A high proportion of the
skinks examined had scars, usually on the sides or dorsal surface
of the body, or of the tail near its base&mdash;wounds which must have
been made by a small, sharp-toothed animal. For example, in May
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
1951, eighteen per cent of 155 skinks captured on the study areas
had such scars. The incidence seemed to vary according to age
and possibly sex; the scars were present in 22.9 per cent of the adult
males, 25.5 per cent of the adult females, and only 9.8 per cent of
the yearlings (these three groups being represented by approximately
equal numbers in the sample). As the scars are more or
less permanent, adults could be expected to show a much higher
incidence than young. Females, being inclined to stay in their
nest burrows and defend them against small predators, may receive
more wounds than the males, which are quicker to escape. None
of the invertebrates present on the study area is sufficiently large or
powerful to inflict such wounds, and none of the birds, reptiles, or
amphibians has a dentition capable of producing them. The wood
mouse (<i>Peromyscus leucopus</i>) is the most abundant small mammal
in the skink&rsquo;s habitat; other rodents present in relatively small numbers
include the prairie vole (<i>Microtus ochrogaster</i>), harvest mouse
(<i>Reithrodontomys megalotis</i>) and pine vole (<i>Microtus pinetorum</i>).
Both voles and harvest mice have been known to kill skinks caught
in the same traps with them, but individuals experimentally placed
with skinks in captivity have failed to molest them and it seems
likely that the attacks in traps were motivated by extreme hunger
or self defense. The irregular scars from lacerated wounds characteristic
of the skinks bear little similarity to rodent bites, in which
the long, sharp-edge incisors make slit-like punctures. Other small
mammals abundant in the places where skinks were studied were
the insectivores: the common mole, short-tailed shrew, and least
shrew (<i>Cryptotis parva</i>).</p>

<p>On one occasion when a large five-lined skink was put in a terrarium
with a recently captured short-tailed shrew, each displayed
strong aversion for the other. The skink crouched, attempting to
conceal itself in the end of the terrarium farthest from the shrew,
and resisted efforts to drive it toward the shrew. In exploring the
terrarium the shrew several times sensed the skink&rsquo;s presence, and
then scampered away in frantic haste. The skink also rushed away
several times when the shrew came close enough to disturb it.
Three days later, when the shrew had become accustomed to the
terrarium, the test was repeated, with different results. The shrew,
having finished the food left for it, was noticed moving about the
terrarium, sniffing and testing objects with its tactile snout, obviously
hungry and searching for more food. The skink was then
dropped near it. In a few seconds the shrew sensed the skink&rsquo;s
presence and pounced upon it, and bit hard on its back. The skink
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
reacted with a violent flexure of its body which caused the shrew
to release it instantly, and both rushed away in opposite directions.
After a few seconds the shrew located the skink again, and moved
up to it with little hesitation but with nervous alert sniffing, and
delivered another quick bite after which the two separated as before,
the skink showing signs of injury. Soon the shrew attacked a
third time, and bit the skink&rsquo;s tail severing it near the base. As the
skink rushed away, the detached tail performed lively squirming
movements, but the shrew seized it, held it down, and began to
eat the exposed flesh on the broken end as the tail writhed. After
rapid nibbling it would drop the tail, and leaving it temporarily
would explore the terrarium. Several times on these trips it encountered
the skink and renewed its attack. As death of the skink
seemed imminent, it was then removed, and it survived with no
apparent ill effects. The wounds inflicted by the shrew bore close
resemblance to those noticed on skinks in the wild. It seemed almost
certain that <i>Blarina</i> had inflicted most of these wounds or all
of them. On subsequent occasions several other captive shrews
that were tested, quickly killed and ate skinks that were introduced
into their containers. The least shrew, <i>Cryptotis</i>, likewise occurred
in all situations where skinks were taken, and in some localities
was more abundant than the larger <i>Blarina</i>. Bites inflicted by
these two kinds of shrews might be indistinguishable, but because
of its larger size, <i>Blarina</i> would seem by far the more formidable
enemy.</p>

<p>Reynolds (1945:367) found <i>E. fasciatus</i> to be the most frequent
reptile in a collection of opossum scats from Missouri, with two
occurrences in 100 fall scats and ten occurrences in 100 spring scats.
Sandidge (1953:98 and 101) recorded one of these skinks among
numerous other items identified from stomach contents of sixty-six
opossums. Probably the opossum is a frequent predator on this skink.
Although no specific instances were obtained on the area of the study,
flat rocks a few inches in diameter frequently have been found
flipped over, larger ones and those solidly anchored in the ground
have been found partly undermined by opossums scratching away
the loose dirt at their edges. The rocks found disturbed by opossums
were typical of those used as shelter by the skink. On many occasions
wire funnel traps set for skinks and other reptiles along hilltop rock
ledges were found to have been disturbed, either shifted in position
or with their rock shelters removed, or rolled downhill or broken
open. Similarly, heavy flat rocks used to cover pitfalls, to protect
the small animals falling into them from predators, often were found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
to have been shifted somewhat, or completely removed. When
such raids became frequent and troublesome, steel traps were set
beside the reptile traps to discourage the raiders or catch them and
determine their identity. On several occasions opossums were caught
and somewhat less frequently, spotted skunks (<i>Spilogale interrupta</i>).
These skunks probably prey regularly on lizards including the five-lined
skink. However no definite records were obtained. Crabb
(1941:356-358) in his food habits study of the spotted skunk in
southeastern Iowa, did not record this or any other species of
reptile among the items identified in 834 scats. On the Reservation
both opossums and skunks were, in many instances, attracted to the
reptile traps by the insects and other arthropods in them, rather
than by lizards. The striped skunk (<i>Mephitis mephitis</i>) is another
of the predators which probably feeds upon the five-lined skink
occasionally on this area.</p>

<p>In the contents of 103 armadillo stomachs collected in west-central
Louisiana, in 1947 and 1948 I found the broken tail of one
<i>Eumeces fasciatus</i>. The lizard itself evidently had escaped (Fitch,
1949a:88). Many clutches of lizard eggs were found in the contents
of the armadillo stomachs and some of these probably were
eggs of <i>Eumeces</i>, which are similar to those of other small lizards
in the same region (<i>Anolis carolinensis</i>, <i>Sceloporus undulatus</i>) in
size, shape, and color.</p>

<p>Among 217 identified prey items from stomachs and scats of
Sonoran skinks (<i>Eumeces obsoletus</i>) from northeastern Kansas were
remains of three hatchling five-lined skinks. Taylor (1953b:212)
recorded that a <i>Eumeces laticeps</i> shipped from Arkansas to Kansas
ate an <i>E. fasciatus</i> that was with it in the container. Several
authors have recorded predation on <i>Eumeces fasciatus</i> by snakes of
various kinds in captivity. Conant (1951:211) recorded that one
was eaten by a blacksnake (<i>Coluber constrictor</i>) placed in the collecting
sack with it. Anderson (1942:211 and 216) recorded that
a king snake (<i>Lampropeltis getulus holbrooki</i>) and a young copperhead
(<i>Ancistrodon contortrix</i>) each fed upon them. Hurter (1911:184)
recorded that a milk snake, <i>Lampropeltis triangulum syspila</i>,
placed in a bucket with a <i>Eumeces fasciatus</i> was found swallowing
it a short time later and its tail had been broken off.</p>

<p>Ruthven (1911:268) mentioned that stomachs of milk snakes,
<i>L. t. triangulum</i>, collected in Michigan contained remains of five-lined
skinks. Ditmars (1907:352) wrote that stomachs of several
<i>L. t. elapsoides</i> contained <i>Eumeces</i>, and Wright and Bishop (1915:167)
wrote of the same kind of king snake in the Okefinokee Swamp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
region: &ldquo;It feeds on ground lizards, skinks, swifts, and other
snakes and lizards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Richard B. Loomis is of the opinion that the five-lined skink
is one of the chief food sources for the milk snake (<i>L. t. syspila</i>).
Having kept many of these snakes in captivity and experimentally
offered them different types of prey, he found that individuals inclined
to feed would avidly seize and eat skinks and young mice,
but other proffered prey, small adult rodents, snakes, or lizards
other than <i>Eumeces</i> were either rejected or were taken with some
hesitation. These milk snakes have habitat preferences similar to
the skink, which would seem to be one of the most available food
sources. Loomis recorded in his field notes that a juvenal blotched
king snake (<i>L. calligaster</i>) 310 mm. in total length, taken on April
8, 1950, seven miles southwest of Tulsa, Oklahoma, had eaten a large
adult <i>E. fasciatus</i>. Another juvenal blotched king snake that he
found under a flat rock near Sunflower, Johnson County, Kansas,
regurgitated an adult five-lined skink. Loomis also recorded a
juvenal rat snake (<i>Elaphe guttata emoryi</i>) and a juvenal pilot black
snake (<i>E. obsoleta</i>) each feeding on individuals of <i>Eumeces fasciatus</i>
in captivity. Uhler, Cottam and Clarke (1939:622) in a study
of the contents of the alimentary tracts of 893 snakes of 18 species,
from the George Washington National Forest, Virginia, found
among the prey items only one skink (species undetermined but
most probably <i>E. fasciatus</i>). It had been eaten by one of the two
corn snakes (<i>Elaphe guttata</i>) that were examined in the study.</p>

<p>On June 11, 1950, in Skink Woods, a young copperhead 335 mm.
in snout-vent length and weighing 27.6 grams, had a gravid female
skink in its stomach. Another young copperhead (335 mm., 36.1
grams) trapped near Rat Woods on August 28, 1953, had in its
stomach a bob-tailed adult five-lined skink. Many copperheads collected
on the Reservation were kept in captivity for short periods,
and from them a total of 44 scats were obtained, each scat containing
the remains of one or more prey animals eaten in the wild. Of this
total, five scats contained remains of <i>Eumeces fasciatus</i>, which was
one of the more frequent items, although small mammals collectively
made up the bulk of the scat contents.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Parasites</h3>

<p>Skinks, like many other lizards, are likely to be infested with parasites.
Little attention was devoted to the endoparasites in the
present study, but they were noted from time to time. On several
occasions small nematodes and flukes were seen in feces voided by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
lizards which were handled. Small white cysts were seen in the
body cavities of several that were dissected.</p>

<p>Harwood (1932:65) examined for endoparasites nine <i>E. fasciatus</i>
along with many other reptiles and amphibians collected near
Houston, Texas. Most of them were infested and five kinds of
helminths were identified. Two of the skinks were infested with
<i>Oswaldocruzia pipiens</i>, a spirurid nematode that was also present
in various other lizards, snakes, toads and frogs from the same
region; four had <i>Comocercoides dukae</i>, an oxyurid nematode also
present in various lizards, snakes, turtles, and frogs; one had in its
intestine <i>Oochoristica eumecis</i>, named as a new species by Harwood,
and found only in <i>Eumeces</i>; one contained <i>Cysticercus</i> sp.
in its body cavity, present in great abundance as white globular
structures .6 mm. in diameter (Harwood states that possibly these
were larvae of <i>Oochoristica</i>). One skink contained <i>Mesocoelium
americanum</i>, a dicrocoelid trematode which was found also in the
brown skink (<i>Scincella laterale</i>) and DeKay&rsquo;s snake (<i>Storeria
dekayi</i>).</p>

<p>The ectoparasites of these skinks consist mainly of chiggers.
Wharton (1952:135) lists three species; <i>Trombicula alfreddugesi</i>,
<i>T. splendens</i>, and <i>T. gurneyi</i>. The first species is the common pest
chigger of humans and domestic animals in the United States, and
south through tropical America. Wharton lists 136 known hosts
which are fairly evenly divided among mammals, birds and reptiles;
he lists four kinds of frogs and toads. <i>Trombicula splendens</i> is a
similar and closely related species which has been recorded from
thirty-eight vertebrate hosts including mammals, birds, reptiles, and
a tree-toad. <i>Trombicula gurneyi</i> belongs to a separate subgenus
and it was originally recorded from <i>Eumeces fasciatus</i> which seems
to be one of the principal hosts.</p>

<p>Two of these mites, <i>T. alfreddugesi</i> and <i>T. gurneyi</i>, were on
skinks collected on the Reservation, and nearby areas. A four year
study of the chiggers in this general region by Loomis (MS),
Wolfenbarger (1953) and Kardos (MS) has clarified the ecological
relationships of the several kinds of chiggers present, including their
local distribution with respect to vegetation, soil type, moisture and
temperature, host preferences, and seasonal occurrence. At the
quarry, Rat Woods and the pond rock pile, the chigger population
consisted chiefly of <i>T. alfreddugesi</i>, while at Skink Woods <i>T. gurneyi</i>
was also abundant. In some local situations where they are among
the most abundant of vertebrates the skinks probably are important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
as hosts of <i>T. gurneyi</i>. An individual skink may have dozens of
chiggers on it at one time but usually there are fewer.</p>

<p>There are several favorable sites of attachment. The most favored
site is in the axilla. There the scales are minute and granular with
exposed areas of thin and tender skin, and the chiggers are well
protected from dessication and are not likely to be rubbed off as
the skink moves about. Other favorite sites of attachment are:
about the insertion of the hind limb, about the cloacal opening, on
the eyelids and on the toes. Only occasionally are chiggers found
attached on the dorsal surface. When attached in protected spots
in the tender skin of the axilla or groin, they are often in dense
clusters of a dozen or more. Damage to the skin resulting from the
attachment of the first chiggers renders conditions more favorable
for the attachment of others. At Rat Ledge and at the quarry,
many of the larger Sonoran skinks (<i>Eumeces obsoletus</i>) were captured,
and individuals were far more heavily infested than were
<i>E. fasciatus</i> from the same places. A single Sonoran skink might be
found to have hundreds of chiggers, widely distributed over its body
with concentrations at the axillae, groins, lateral neck region, and
any injured spots where the protective armor of scales was broken.
The reasons for the greater susceptibility of <i>E. obsoletus</i> are not
entirely clear. It is a larger, less active species with coarser scalation,
and is more subterranean in its habits.</p>

<p>The chiggers that attach to skinks seem to occasion but little discomfort.
There is no local swelling and inflammation such as occurs
in humans. The infestations observed in five-lined skinks were not
sufficiently severe to cause debilitation or any noticeable symptoms.
There is, however, a possibility that chiggers are vectors of microorganisms
causing diseases in reptiles, just as they are for certain
mammals (including humans) in some parts of the world.</p>

<p>Bishopp and Trembley (1935:42) record a single kind of tick,
<i>Ixodes ricinus scapularis</i> Say, the black-legged tick, as parasitic in
its immature stages on <i>Eumeces fasciatus</i>. This tick, however, has
been recorded principally from mammals, of which many kinds
serve as hosts for its larval, nymphal, and adult stages.</p>


<h2>Population</h2>

<h3 class="smcap">Composition</h3>

<p>Population structure obviously differs from place to place and
from time to time. Because of the differences in secretiveness and
elusiveness between young and adults and between males and females,
true sex ratios and age ratios are obscured. In the period of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
weeks between the emergence from hibernation and the onset of
the breeding season, these skinks tend to be less secretive than at
other times, and secondary sexual and age differences in behavior
are minimized. A sample at this season should be more representative
of the true population composition than samples taken at
other times of year. In a sample of 308 skinks available for the
month of April, including the collections made on the Reservation
and on nearby areas, in 1949, 1950, 1951, and 1952, 36.7 per cent
were adult males, 28.3 per cent were adult females, and 35.0 per
cent were young. That these figures cannot, however, be accepted
as an accurate indication of the population composition is shown
by the data from the areas where intensive population studies were
made. Data are most complete from Skink Woods. For 292 adults
taken there over a four year period, the sex ratio was 100:122.6.
On this area after the first year of study a substantial proportion of
the individuals recorded were repeaters from one year to the next,
and in some cases for three or even four successive years. Many
could be definitely assigned to a known age group. By analogy
the majority of others could be tentatively assigned with some assurance
on the basis of measurements, and relatively few were of
indeterminate status. By assigning each of these indeterminate individuals
to one or another age group, on the basis of greatest probability,
the approximate composition of the population could be
determined. Of 611 adults, 55 per cent were &ldquo;two-year olds&rdquo; (in
the season between their second and third hibernations, which was
their first breeding season). The percentage was not significantly
different in the two sexes.</p>

<p>On the average, a pair of adults produces somewhat more than
nine eggs per year. From the time individuals of a brood start
their development in the egg until they are breeding adults two
years later, they undergo such drastic reduction in numbers that,
on the average, approximately only one per brood survives. Most
of the mortality probably occurs early, especially before hatching,
also in the inexperienced hatchlings, and in the first hibernation.
In spring, after emergence from hibernation, young are generally
taken in smaller numbers than are adults. Their relative scarcity
is only apparent, owing to greater secretiveness, and greater elusiveness
when found. In spring, newly matured adults (age class
about 21 months) may be taken in somewhat larger numbers than
young (age class about 9 months). The latter obviously must be
more numerous, in a stable population however, as the 21 month
age class necessarily has sustained some loss since it was 9 months
old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Success of the annual brood varies greatly from year to year,
depending on the weather and various other factors. In 1949 evidently
conditions were near optimum; young hatched early and
were especially numerous in late summer. In 1950 these young
hatched in 1949 made up 40 per cent of the total catch (excluding
hatchlings) in Skink Woods and were relatively more numerous
than young of the corresponding age group in other years. In
1951, these young of the 1949 brood, grown to adults, made up 70
per cent of the breeding populations, as against 36 per cent for the
corresponding class in 1950 and 58 per cent for the corresponding
class in 1952.</p>

<p>Even after attainment of adulthood, any given age group evidently
is subject to annual reduction amounting to at least half its
numbers. Within six or seven years, at the most, the original numbers
would be reduced to an insignificant percentage. At an age
of four or five years individuals probably have attained their maximum
size, with obscured pattern and changed proportions suggestive
of advanced age. Occasional individuals possibly attain much
greater age, but certainly few live more than five years. Like most
small animals, the five-lined skink has a short life expectancy and
a rapid population turnover. As compared with mammals of comparable
sizes, the small rodents and insectivores that are this lizard&rsquo;s
community associates and are subject to many of the same hazards,
the skink is notably successful, with a much longer life expectancy.
For these small mammals the life span is seldom as long as a year.
Most kinds of small birds likewise have a life expectancy less than
that of the five-lined skink, although somewhat greater than that
of small mammals.</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Density</h3>

<p>The population density changes constantly, following an annual
cycle with gradual reduction to its lowest ebb in late June or early
July, then rapid increase to a high point a few weeks later when
hatching of the single annual brood has been completed. In a
normally successful breeding season the population is at least
doubled, but reproductive success varies from year to year, as the
population responds to weather conditions that are favorable or
unfavorable, even where the environment remains fairly stable. In
most places, however, local populations continue upward or downward
trends for periods of years in response to successional changes
which cause progressive improvement or deterioration of local habitats.
Local populations are likely to be more or less isolated from
others by areas where the habitat does not exist. Even in an area
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of favorable habitat such as a wooded hillside of several acres, the
population is not at all evenly distributed, but concentrations occur
along rock outcrops, and about decaying logs, or stone piles. In
intervening areas lacking such abundant shelter, and less productive
of food, the population is sparse, or there may be no permanent
residents.</p>

<p>In view of these traits, and the difficulty of obtaining a representative
sample, no precise measurements of population density can be
made. During the time required to secure a sample, the population
undergoes change. At the pond rock pile, an area of approximately
.05 acre, the skinks were found in remarkably high concentrations,
57 in 1949, 85 in 1950, 37 in 1951, and 51 in 1952. These numbers
represent population densities of, respectively, 1120 per acre, 1960
per acre, 746 per acre, and 1000 per acre. No such concentrations
were found elsewhere, and probably do not occur in natural habitat.
The Skink Woods study area of 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> acres is typical of favorable habitat
in the region of the study, and the numbers taken there are more
significant. For 1949 the 74 skinks recorded comprise an incomplete
sample, and the population density of 33 per acre represented
is certainly somewhat too low. For other years the following population
densities (exclusive of hatchlings) are indicated: 1950, 92
per acre; 1951, 61 per acre; 1952, 49 per acre. These figures are only
approximate, of course, and it is difficult to judge how accurately
they reflect the true numbers. Even the most intensive collecting
may be insufficient to obtain every individual on a small area.
Within each season there are shifts of range by some individuals,
off the study area and corresponding shifts onto it by others, so that
the numbers caught in the course of an entire season are somewhat
too high. The individuals taken on the study area may regularly
range beyond its boundaries to some extent, so that the seeming
population density is somewhat too high. Actually this was probably
a minor source of error for the Skink Woods study area, as
nearly half its perimeter was bordered by an open field uninhabitable
for the skinks, and the remaining perimeter adjoined areas
much less favorable than the central portion.</p>

<p>Census of the population of the study area by a ratio such as the
&ldquo;Lincoln Index&rdquo; used in game management studies was scarcely practicable
because of the changing seasonal habits distorting the recorded
ratios of the sexes and of age groups somewhat differently
at different stages of the season. These changing ratios tend to produce
an erroneously high population figure, unless separate computations
are made from the data for adult males, adult females, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
young. Census figures obtained by this method were erratic but
seemed to bear out in a general way, the population figures based
on total numbers of individuals taken.</p>

<p>In favorable habitat where they occur in high populations of 50
to 100 per acre in spring, these lizards must attain a biomass of a
pound or more per acre. Biomass in a population probably fluctuates
but little during the course of the annual cycle, even though
the number of individuals changes greatly. The steady elimination
of individuals through various mortality factors, is compensated for
by rapid growth of the young.</p>


<h2><a name="Summary" id="Summary"></a>Summary</h2>

<p>Five-lined skinks were studied for four consecutive years in four
small areas, totalling approximately ten acres, on the University of
Kansas Natural History Reservation, Douglas County, Kansas. The
information gained from intensive study on these areas has been
supplemented by data from skinks collected elsewhere in northeastern
Kansas, and from an extensive literature pertaining to this
species.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Eumeces</i>, to which the common five-lined skink belongs,
has more than 50 species, occurring throughout Central
America, North America to the latitude of southern Canada, and,
in the Old World, across southern Asia and North Africa. Within
the genus, the five-lined skinks, comprising a dozen species, form a
natural group of closely related forms. In this &ldquo;<i>fasciatus</i> group&rdquo;
nine of the species occur in the Orient, Japan and neighboring
islands and the adjacent mainland. The remaining three, including
<i>E. fasciatus</i>, occur in the eastern United States. Specific differences
are to be found in details of pattern, scalation, and size, and, in
some instances, they were long unrecognized. <i>E. fasciatus</i> coincides
closely in its distribution with the Deciduous Forest Biome of southeastern
North America. An early Tertiary deciduous forest in
Alaska and probably in the Bering Strait area, evidently growing
in a humid, mild-temperate climate, included genera of plants that
are now most characteristic of southeastern North America along
with other kinds now characteristic of forest remnants in southeastern
Asia, and still others characteristic of the western United
States. The <i>fasciatus</i> group seemingly dispersed from a northern
center that may have coincided with the early Tertiary deciduous
forest of Alaska.</p>

<p><i>Eumeces laticeps</i> almost coincides in distribution with <i>E. fasciatus</i>,
but does not occur quite so far north, and unlike <i>fasciatus</i> it occurs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
throughout Florida. Young are similar in appearance but <i>laticeps</i>
is a larger, more powerful species, notably arboreal in its habits.
<i>E. inexpectatus</i> much more closely resembles <i>fasciatus</i>, and ecological
divergence is slight. It is characteristic of hot and dry rocky
areas in open woods, and is more southern in distribution, although
there is extensive overlap with <i>fasciatus</i> and <i>inexpectatus</i> shares
nearly all of its range with <i>laticeps</i>.</p>

<p><i>Eumeces fasciatus</i> is most abundant in well-drained, open, rocky
situations within its forest habitat. It is scarce or absent in bottomland
forest that is subject to flooding and requires a forest with
openings in the leaf canopy so that sunshine patches for basking are
available. In northeastern Kansas, at least, woodlands that are
browsed by livestock, and have scanty undergrowth, provide better
habitat than those that are protected. <i>E. fasciatus</i> is likely to be
most abundant in cutover woodland, and may reach greatest numbers
in artificial situations, such as old rock piles, or the vicinity of
deserted sawmills. In the north, the species is increasingly confined
to open situations, while in the south it may inhabit heavily
wooded areas. An abundant supply of moisture is a necessity and
the species is limited to a climate of high humidity. Dew normally
supplies the source of drinking water, without which the skinks
rapidly become emaciated and die. Optimum body temperature
was determined to be near 34&#176;C., from a series of temperature
readings taken both under natural conditions and in confinement
under conditions permitting behavioral thermoregulation. By thermoregulatory
behavior, active skinks in the wild tend to maintain
their body temperatures near this level over a wide range of environmental
temperatures. They can tolerate body temperatures only
a few degrees higher, but, within a range of several degrees below
34&#176;C., efficiency is little impaired and incentive to make readjustment
is slight. At progressively lower temperatures skinks become
slower and less efficient. They are, however, capable of copulation
at temperatures down to 21&#176;C, and of feeding at 16&#176;C. At 10&#176;C.
they are slow and clumsy, barely capable of normal locomotion.
At temperatures near freezing they are torpid; they can survive
temperatures a little below freezing, but cannot survive being frozen
solid. More than half the year is spent in hibernation in northeastern
Kansas. Weight loss is slight during hibernation.</p>

<p>Normally the skinks emerge from hibernation in early April in
northeastern Kansas, several weeks earlier in the southern states and
correspondingly later in the northern part of the range. Maximum
activity occurs in the period of weeks following emergence; interrupted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
from time to time by cold weather which necessitates return
to torpidity. After approximately three weeks of activity the adults
attain breeding condition. Breeding males acquire a salmon red
suffusion of the head region. They become pugnacious and fight
on sight. Fighting does not involve territorial defense. In confinement
males may mutilate or kill each other. In their search
for females, and fighting, the breeding males are so much more
active and conspicuous than they are at other times of year that
published descriptions usually refer to males as red-headed, with
no cognizance of the fact that this condition exists for only a few
weeks in the annual cycle. Old adult males lose the striped pattern
and blue color of the tail of the young, and are golden brown, usually
a little darker on the sides. Males find females by a combination
of sight and scent. Sexual relations are promiscuous, and there is
but little courtship behavior. The male pursues the female and
grasps in his jaws loose skin at or behind her shoulder region, and
maintains this hold during copulation which lasts about five minutes.
Within a few days after insemination, usually in early May, females
become actively hostile to males. In late May or early June the
gravid females become unusually secretive and excavate nest burrows
in damp soil under flat rocks, or in rotten wood of decaying
logs and stumps. The single annual clutch of eggs is laid in June.
The average clutch is somewhat more than nine eggs, with larger
and older females slightly exceeding younger and smaller females
in average productivity. The female remains in the nest burrow
with her clutch most of the time, from laying until after hatching.
She alters the nest burrow, dampens it in time of drought, keeps
the cavity from being filled with loose soil, prevents the eggs from
adhering to the sides or floor of the cavity, and she may repulse
certain small predators capable of destroying the eggs if they were
left undefended. When they are laid, the eggs are approximately
11 &#215; 7<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> mm. and weigh .4 grams or a little less. By hatching time
they have enlarged to 15 &#215; 11 mm. and each weighs about a gram.
Recorded incubation periods vary from 27 days to 47 days; development
of the embryo is slowed at low temperatures, and eggs experimentally
kept in a refrigerator at 11&#176; to 12&#176;C. for periods of days
hatched later than others of the same clutch that developed under
normal conditions, indicating that development was almost halted in
the eggs kept at such low temperatures. Eggs are, however, tolerant
of a wide range of temperature, and can develop in nearly dry soil,
or can survive partial submersion in water for at least two days.
Under weather conditions prevailing in 1951, incubation periods
of about six weeks were recorded. Incubation may be shortened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
by retention of ova in the oviducts in early stages of embryonic
development. Hatching may occur from the first week of July to
mid-August, but in any one year most clutches hatch within two
weeks of each other. Hatching of eggs in a clutch extends over a
day or two. The hatchling gradually becoming active inside the
egg, slits the leathery shell with its egg tooth, and spends several
hours in the early stages of emergence. After resting with head
and shoulders protruding, becoming adjusted to the outside environment
and gaining strength, it lunges from the egg. For a day or two
after hatching, the young remains in the nest, being slow and feeble,
and handicapped in its movements by the protruding belly distended
by the yolk mass. The female usually remains in the nest cavity
for a day or two after the eggs hatch, showing affinity for the young
by curling around them protectively. Family ties are broken as
soon as the young leave the nest, and they do not return. Hatchlings
average a little less than an inch in snout-vent length, and have a
sharply defined five-lined pattern on a black ground color, and vivid
blue tail. Hatchlings make rapid growth in late summer, and by the
time of their retirement into hibernation, the more successful may
have doubled in length, and may have increased their original
weight, of approximately .3 or .4 grams, more than eight-fold. After
emergence from their first hibernation the young continue their
rapid growth. When they are a year old, some of them are as large
as small adults. However, they can usually be distinguished from
adults by the more sharply defined pattern. These grown young
retain the hatchling pattern but the contrast between stripes and
ground color, and between body and tail is not quite so sharp.
Especially in those with regenerated tails, the vivid blue of the
hatchling&rsquo;s tail has become much dulled. By the time they retire
to their second hibernation, the young have mostly grown to small
adult size. A small percentage are retarded in their growth and fail
to mature. Upon emergence from their second hibernation, the
grown young mature sexually and participate in the annual breeding
season, in early May, and they may comprise the majority of breeding
adults. The ratio of new adults to old adults however varies
from year to year depending on the varying fortunes of successive
annual broods. The new adults overlap older ones in size, but
are usually distinguishable on the basis of their coloration, as they
retain the striped body pattern (dulled, especially on the head)
and with distinctly blue color on the tail. In skinks that are three
years old or more, the dorsal stripes have become obscured and
partly blended with the ground color, which becomes progressively
paler with advancing age. Metamorphosis is most complete in old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
males, which retain no trace of the stripes or of the blue color on
the tail. Old females usually retain the dark lateral area, and the
tail is usually bluish gray, with a blue scale remaining here and
there if the tail has not been regenerated.</p>

<p>Most individuals lose their original tails, however. By the time
the young are approximately two months old, about half have had
their tails broken, and by the time they are a year old and have
grown to small adult size, three-fourths have regenerated tails.
Some individuals may have had their tails broken and regenerated
many times. Tails regenerate rapidly and most of the growth is
made within the first few weeks. The regenerated tail is not so long
as the original lost portion.</p>

<p>Individuals tend to stay within small areas which are their regular
home ranges. These ranges are only a fraction of an acre in extent,
but vary considerably in size and shape according to the individual
and the situation. Home ranges of approximately 90-foot diameter
for adult males and young, and a little more than 30-foot diameter
for adult females are indicated. A home range generally centers
about some environmental feature providing shelter and food, such
as a log, hollow tree, or rock outcrop. Activity tends to be concentrated
in the central part of the home range. An individual
may continue to occupy the same home range throughout its lifetime,
or it may gradually alter its range, shifting by slow stages into
a new area. Some individuals seem to &ldquo;get lost&rdquo; or voluntarily shift,
and settle in a new area which may be hundreds of feet removed
from the original range. Shifts are most likely to occur after
emergence from hibernation, when the lizard finds its habitat somewhat
altered. Individuals released in areas strange to them settled
down and established new home ranges, either immediately or
after brief wandering.</p>

<p>The five-lined skink is a predator, occasionally taking small vertebrates
(lizards and possibly newborn mice) but depending for
most of its food on invertebrates. Of these it takes a wide variety.
Spiders are the mainstay of the diet, and various salticids and
lycosids are the kinds most frequently preyed upon. Phalangids are
also eaten. Of insects, orthopterans (including roaches, ceuthophilid
and gryllid crickets, grouse locusts, and small grasshoppers)
are most important in the food. Larvae of moths and both larvae
and adults of beetles are also taken in quantity. Small snails make
up an important part of the diet, and the skinks often eat their own
sloughed skins. Less frequently taken food items include certain
large ants, centipedes, moths, and miscellaneous insects. Rarely
the adult skinks may even eat eggs or young of their own species.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Prey is found by sight and scent, and consists of almost any small
animals within a certain size range (small enough to be swallowed
entire, but large enough to make up a substantial part of a meal) of
types which are not too heavily armored, lack noxious defensive
secretions, and live on or in the ground or decaying wood. They
are ordinarily crushed in the jaws or battered against the ground,
and then swallowed entire.</p>

<p>Natural enemies of the five-lined skink certainly include the broad-winged
hawk and probably other kinds of hawks and also include
various predatory mammals such as the opossum, armadillo, skunks,
moles and shrews; snakes (the copperhead, milk snake, king snake,
corn snake, and probably others), the Sonoran skink and even the
closely related but larger <i>Eumeces laticeps</i>. On the Reservation, the
short-tailed shrew was certainly the commonest, and probably by
far the most important natural enemy. A high proportion of the
skinks examined had scars resembling those inflicted by shrews experimentally
confined with skinks in captivity. In time of danger
escape reactions vary according to the type of enemy and the attending
circumstances. Frequently an alarmed skink may escape
into a hole or crevice, running directly to it from a distance of several
yards. Under other circumstances a skink may burrow into
ground litter of dry leaves and other debris, or may even dive and
hide underwater. One of the commonest escape reactions is climbing
tree trunks. It occurs even in gravid females that are slow and
clumsy, being weighed down with eggs. Generally the skink stays
on the main trunk of the tree, attempting to conceal itself by utilizing
the screening vegetation that is available. In the young, especially,
the bright blue tail seems to be used as a decoy, for it is carried,
arched high and waved conspicuously as the lizard moves
about. Rapid lashing movements of the conspicuous tail as the
animal darts erratically for shelter may serve to confuse a pursuer,
at least as to the direction that the skink has taken.</p>

<p>This skink is parasitized by various helminths, both cestodes and
nematodes, which inhabit the digestive tract and body cavity. Some
of these infest many kinds of amphibian and reptilian hosts, but
others may be confined to the five-lined skink. Their life cycles,
and effect upon the host are not well known. Ectoparasites consist
principally of chiggers. Three kinds have been recorded on the
skinks; <i>Trombicula alfreddugesi</i>, <i>T. splendens</i>, and <i>T. gurneyi</i>. The
first two are common pest chiggers which attack humans as well as
a wide variety of other mammalian, avian and reptilian hosts. <i>T.
gurneyi</i> is a less common species found mainly on <i>Eumeces fasciatus</i>
and confined to its woodland habitat.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
